<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Wernersville PA?</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter or summer season, having a working HVAC system is vital. At Lowe's, we have a range of heating and cooling systems-- from heating systems and heat pumps to window air conditioning system and portable a/c unit Plus, we provide a/c installation and heating installation by licensed expert independent installers.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
