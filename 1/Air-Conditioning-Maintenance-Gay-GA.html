<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c unit are performance-tested to overcome severe or uncommon roadway and weather conditions.

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a terrible, terrible summer season.<p>
