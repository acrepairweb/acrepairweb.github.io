Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
