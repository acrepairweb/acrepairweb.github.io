Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
