<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it may work as a path to bring the pollutants inside.
