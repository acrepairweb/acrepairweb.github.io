<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using All the time.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
