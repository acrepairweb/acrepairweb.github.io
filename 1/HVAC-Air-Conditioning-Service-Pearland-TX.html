They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
