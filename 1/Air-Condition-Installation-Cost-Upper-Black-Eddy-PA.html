<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
