<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, lorries such as cars, trains, ships, aircrafts and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
