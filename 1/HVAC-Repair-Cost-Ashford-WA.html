<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
