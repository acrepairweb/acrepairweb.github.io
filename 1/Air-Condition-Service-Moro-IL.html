<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
