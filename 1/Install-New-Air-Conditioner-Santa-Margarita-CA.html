<h3>Ventilation System in Santa Margarita CA</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, vicious summer season.<p>
