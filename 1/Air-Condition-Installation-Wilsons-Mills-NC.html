<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
