Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
