<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, uncomplicated and a completely enjoyable person to have around that whole time. His time and competence to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heater) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
