<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered excellent client service at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the market.<p>
