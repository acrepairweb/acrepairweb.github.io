<p>Today's house convected heat systems make the most of infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one area like a bathroom floor or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
