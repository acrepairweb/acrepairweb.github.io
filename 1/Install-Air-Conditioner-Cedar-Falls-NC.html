<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Cedar Falls NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface area of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in warmth at a lower total temperature level-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." In other words, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of convenience.
