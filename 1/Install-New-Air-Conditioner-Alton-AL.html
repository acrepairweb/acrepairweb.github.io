<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products.
