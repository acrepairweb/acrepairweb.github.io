After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source systems. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
