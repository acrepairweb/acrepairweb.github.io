<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Aurora IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
