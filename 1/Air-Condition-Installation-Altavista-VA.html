<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Altavista VA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
