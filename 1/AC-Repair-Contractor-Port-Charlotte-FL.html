<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
