<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
