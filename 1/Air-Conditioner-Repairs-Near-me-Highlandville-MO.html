<p>Resideo uses a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System options for both brand-new building and construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air contaminants can lead to asthmatic and allergic reactions, infections and other illness that include the lungs, nose and throat. For instance, pet cats, caged birds and rodents, and dogs can produce other and dander particles that can trigger allergies or asthma signs in some people. Secondhand smoke is also harmful to people, specifically children.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Generally, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that should be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
