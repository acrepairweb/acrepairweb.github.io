<h3>HVAC Installation in Ethridge TN</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
