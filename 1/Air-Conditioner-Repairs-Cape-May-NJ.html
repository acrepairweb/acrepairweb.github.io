DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
