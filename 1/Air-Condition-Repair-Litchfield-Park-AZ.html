This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
