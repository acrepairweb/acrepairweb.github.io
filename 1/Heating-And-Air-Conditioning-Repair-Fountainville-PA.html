<h3>Electric Furnace in Fountainville PA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on unusual occasions.<p>
