<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
