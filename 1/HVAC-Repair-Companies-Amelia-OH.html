<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
