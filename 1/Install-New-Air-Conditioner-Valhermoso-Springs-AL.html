<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust.

<p>The most typical type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive choice, but more recent systems can be really energy efficient.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
