<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in regards to environmental costs. It safeguards the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or pollutants because the energy utilized to heat your house is drawn out directly from the ground. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.
