<p>Initially, in regards to advantages, heating the entire home or structure from one unit makes things easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating system from the home is a perk for some house owners.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
