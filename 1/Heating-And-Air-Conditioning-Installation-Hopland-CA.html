This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
