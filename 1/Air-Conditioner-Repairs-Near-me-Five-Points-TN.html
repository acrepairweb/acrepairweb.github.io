The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned thoroughly before colder seasons begin.

If your furnace is in an extremely poor condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
