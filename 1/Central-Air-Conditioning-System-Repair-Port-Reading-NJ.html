A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>

Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
