<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
