<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
