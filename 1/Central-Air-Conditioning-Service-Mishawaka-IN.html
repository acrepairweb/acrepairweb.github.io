Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
