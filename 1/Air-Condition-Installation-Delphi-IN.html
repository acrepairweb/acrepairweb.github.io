There are several design approaches in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
