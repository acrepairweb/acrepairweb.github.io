<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
