<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
