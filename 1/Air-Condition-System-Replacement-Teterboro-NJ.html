<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
