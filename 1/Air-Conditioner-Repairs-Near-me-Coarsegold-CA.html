<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the right temperature.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should call in a professional to check and repair the system.<p>
