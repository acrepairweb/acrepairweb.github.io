Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.
