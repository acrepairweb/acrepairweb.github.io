The present trend in house construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to contaminants throughout cooking.

Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
