<p>Energy performance can be improved even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
