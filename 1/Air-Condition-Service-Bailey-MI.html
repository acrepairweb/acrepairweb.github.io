Central air conditioners should be expertly inspected and changed before the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>
