<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Sperryville VA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.
