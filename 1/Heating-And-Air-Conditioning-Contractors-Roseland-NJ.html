<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Roseland NJ</h3>
<p>Cooling and refrigeration are supplied through the elimination of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is used either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a complimentary cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (usually water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Because they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
