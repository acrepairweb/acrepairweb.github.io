<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; flooring, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
