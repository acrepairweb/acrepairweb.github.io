<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
