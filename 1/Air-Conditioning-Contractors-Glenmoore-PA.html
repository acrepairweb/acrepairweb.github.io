<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
