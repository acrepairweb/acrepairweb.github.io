If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
