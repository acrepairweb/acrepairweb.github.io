<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
