<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
