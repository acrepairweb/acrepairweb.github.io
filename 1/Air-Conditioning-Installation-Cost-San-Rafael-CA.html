<p>Similar to most home improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary commonly based upon the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
