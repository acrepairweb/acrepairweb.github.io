<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
