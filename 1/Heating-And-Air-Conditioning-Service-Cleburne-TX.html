<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
