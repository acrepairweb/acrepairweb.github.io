<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers throughout summer seasons. The very best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons start. Constantly make certain that the furnace is cleaned up every year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. If your furnace is in a very bad condition, maybe it is time to start considering buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
