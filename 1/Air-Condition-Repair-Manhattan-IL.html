<p>A routine furnace tune up can make the most of effectiveness and offer longer lasting home heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can determine a problem that will need a considerable investment to correct. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the expensive repair and delight in ongoing convenience from your existing heater? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary dedication to changing the furnace?
