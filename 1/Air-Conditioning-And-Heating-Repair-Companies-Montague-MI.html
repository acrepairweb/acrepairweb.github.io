<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC.
