<h3>Installation of HVAC in Sunset SC</h3>
<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger also originates from burning things.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
