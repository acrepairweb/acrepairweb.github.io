<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
