<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Palmyra IN</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
