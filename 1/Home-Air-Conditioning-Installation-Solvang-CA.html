<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
