<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms.

Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
