<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank.

<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in Bridgewater VA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that someone as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
