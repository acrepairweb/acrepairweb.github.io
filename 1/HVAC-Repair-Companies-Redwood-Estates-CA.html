<p>The first ac system and fridges used flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant.
