<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at North Middletown KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
