<p>Improve your services, make more services revenue, and offer a remarkable client experience. To ensure the system you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the exact kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the same size system you presently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Basically, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
