<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air may likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because required air heater flow air-borne pollutants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a variety of different unfavorable impacts. Radiant heat systems don't distribute air at all, which in fact improves your indoor air quality by restricting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
