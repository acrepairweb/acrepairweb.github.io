HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
