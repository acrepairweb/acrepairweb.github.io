<h3>Window Air Conditioner in West MS</h3>
<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the pollutant source away from occupants or perhaps transferring susceptible occupants.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in West MS?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
