<p>A health survey need to be established and distributed to all worried workers. Such a tool ought to identify the number of people impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health signs or diseases; determine all machines run in the work environment; show the kind of outdoors air contamination; and identify prospective sources of task tension.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
