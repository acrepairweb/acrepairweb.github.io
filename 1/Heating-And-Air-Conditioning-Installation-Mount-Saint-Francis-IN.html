<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Mount Saint Francis IN</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
