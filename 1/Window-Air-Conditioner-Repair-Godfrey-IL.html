<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Godfrey IL</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
