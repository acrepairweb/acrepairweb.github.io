<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
