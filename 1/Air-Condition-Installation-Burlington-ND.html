<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is clogged up or dirty Before attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
