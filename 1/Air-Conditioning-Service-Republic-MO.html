<p>We take a look at hints before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
