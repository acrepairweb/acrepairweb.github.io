<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 30 days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a couple of years back, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then.
