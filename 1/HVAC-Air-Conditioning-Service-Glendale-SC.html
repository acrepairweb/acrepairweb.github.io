<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
