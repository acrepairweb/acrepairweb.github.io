<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase.
