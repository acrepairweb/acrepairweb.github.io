<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Santa Clara CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
