<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
