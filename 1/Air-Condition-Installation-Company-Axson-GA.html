<p>Move the thermostat setting to heat." A furnace can be intimidating-- particularly when the heat won't turn on. However, there is good news from furnace repair pros.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Many HVAC service technicians often discover themselves operating in confined and uneasy spaces, at severe heights, and often in hazardous conditions like extreme weather (to service outside heatpump and heat exchangers).
