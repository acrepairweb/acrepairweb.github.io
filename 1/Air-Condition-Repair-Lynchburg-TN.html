Depending on the type of system installed, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the house.

An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
