<p>It's not advised for uncertified people to check & repair air conditioning & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
