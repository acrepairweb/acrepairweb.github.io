<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
