It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>Room a/c unit include a thermostat sensor, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air coming into the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the air conditioning system might cycle constantly or act erratically.
