<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
