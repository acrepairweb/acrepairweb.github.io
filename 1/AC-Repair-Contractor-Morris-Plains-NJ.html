<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
