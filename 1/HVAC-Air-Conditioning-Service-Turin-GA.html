"Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not get rid of direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to significantly reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Subsequently, the most effective method to lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
