<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
