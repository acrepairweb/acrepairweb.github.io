They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
