<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning items, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
