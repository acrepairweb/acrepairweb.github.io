<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Eastlake CO</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
