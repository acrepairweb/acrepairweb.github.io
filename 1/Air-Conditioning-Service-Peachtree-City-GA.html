<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
