Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
