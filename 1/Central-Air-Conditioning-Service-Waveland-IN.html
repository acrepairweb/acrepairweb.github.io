<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
