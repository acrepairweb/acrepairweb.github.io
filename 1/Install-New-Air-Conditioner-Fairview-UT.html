<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Fairview UT Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
