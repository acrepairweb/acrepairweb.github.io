<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
