<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>If you observe a decline in heat output, initially make certain the air filter is clean and in good condition. Next, inspect other components of the furnace for any build-up of dust, dirt and debris, a low-cost repair that can help enhance performance. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned effectively. Try moving it far from direct sunlight given that this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this takes place. You might also need to check your insulation to make sure that warm air does not escape from your space through numerous openings.<p>
