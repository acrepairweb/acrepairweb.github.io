<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
