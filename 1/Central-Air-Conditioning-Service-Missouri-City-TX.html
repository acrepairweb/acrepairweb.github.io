Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
