<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
