In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

They weren't cheap but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
