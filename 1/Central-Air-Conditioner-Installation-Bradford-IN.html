<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
