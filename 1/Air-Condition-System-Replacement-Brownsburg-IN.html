<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher.
