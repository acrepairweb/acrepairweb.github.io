<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
