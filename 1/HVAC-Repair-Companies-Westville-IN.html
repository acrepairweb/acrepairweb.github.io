Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the unit is combined.
