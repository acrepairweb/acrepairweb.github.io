<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heater, you might search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
