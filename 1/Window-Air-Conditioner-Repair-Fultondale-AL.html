<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.

<p>Many household items launch natural vapors that can cause adverse health effects. These effects may include nose and throat inflammation, headaches, lightheadedness, and queasiness. Products containing these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, pastime materials, disinfectants, deodorizers, and cleaners. Formaldehyde is another natural vapor that can trigger similar signs. Formaldehyde can be discovered in brand-new building products, such as plywood, fiberboard, particle, and paneling board, and in cigarette smoke and lots of consumer products.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
