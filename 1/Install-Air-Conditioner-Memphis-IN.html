<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
