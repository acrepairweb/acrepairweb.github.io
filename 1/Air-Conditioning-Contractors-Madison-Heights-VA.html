<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
