<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures construct up inside your home.<p>

<p>Many individuals underestimate the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is usually pictured as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside, and over half that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>Brands carried: When seeking estimates for brand-new or replacement heating or cooling devices make sure to ask prospective companies what specific manufacturers or devices brands they carry. Unlike other home improvement contractors, HVAC companies often only bring a small selection of brand names. If you're doing your own rate comparison research on new equipment, you may need to limit your employing choices to companies that specialize in your equipment brand name of option.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are ending up being more common as available services in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been prevalent, as consumers remain largely oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>

If you observe the advancement of any abnormalities with your air conditioning system, call the AC repair experts at Stability Energy Systems for reputable repairs made with the proficiency your a/c needs.
