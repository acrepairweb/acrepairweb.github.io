<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
