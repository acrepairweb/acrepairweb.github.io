<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and extremely well done. The installers were polite and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss out on information that produces a job very well done. I really highly advise the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Only an expert can properly diagnose why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems unusual or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you have to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
