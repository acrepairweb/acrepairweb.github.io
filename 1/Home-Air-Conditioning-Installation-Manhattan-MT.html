<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful results, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are required to produce specific health problems. Individuals also respond extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is required to better understand which health impacts happen after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short periods of time.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
