<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heating, you need to give major thought to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well since it performs and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work reasonably well. Carpets will straight insulate the floor from the room, decreasing efficiency, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
