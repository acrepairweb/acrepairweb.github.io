<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so.
