<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
