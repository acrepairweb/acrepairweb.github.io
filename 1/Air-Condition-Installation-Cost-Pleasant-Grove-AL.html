<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Pleasant Grove AL</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is unclean or blocked Before trying to repair any problem, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Get in touch with a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
