<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A skilled technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

In the summer months, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer trustworthy and constant cooling and heating.<p>
