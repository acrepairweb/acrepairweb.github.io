<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

At present, very little is known about what health results happen from the levels of organics generally discovered in houses. Numerous natural substances are known to cause cancer in animals; some are believed of causing, or are understood to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>
