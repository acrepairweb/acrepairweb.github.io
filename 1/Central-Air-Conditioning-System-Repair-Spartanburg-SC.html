The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
