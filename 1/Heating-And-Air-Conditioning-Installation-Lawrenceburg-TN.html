<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
