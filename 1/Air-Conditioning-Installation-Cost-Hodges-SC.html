<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Hodges SC Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Before you pick a contractor, think about bids from at least 3 to five respectable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer complaints have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is valid and active. Compare the various furnace performance rankings recommended by the private contractors to choose the model and system that finest suits your energy needs. Keep in mind that energy-star ranked devices will save you cash in the end but might involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
