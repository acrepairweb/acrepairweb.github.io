If your furnace remains in an extremely poor condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
