<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Midland NC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are wet or moist structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and home plants.<p>

Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that specific area.

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
