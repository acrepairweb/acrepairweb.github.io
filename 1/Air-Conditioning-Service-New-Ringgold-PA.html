<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, particularly considering that we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, specifically if you make it part of a construct or renovation project. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat option can be set up as a DIY task as it is basic to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, all set to be presented in location. Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the spaces dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
