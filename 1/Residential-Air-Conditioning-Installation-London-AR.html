<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution. If the existing system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be identified and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a high-end item and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) However prior to you commit to what can be a significant remodeling project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is a proper service for your particular house heating needs.<p>
