<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
