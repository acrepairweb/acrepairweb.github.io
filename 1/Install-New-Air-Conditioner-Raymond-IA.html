<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
