Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
