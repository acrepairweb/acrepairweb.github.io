<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Manvel TX</h3>
<p>Most people do not know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A constraint in your drain pipelines causes a water leak. There are many different places a blockage can occur. One of the primary areas where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
