<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues.
