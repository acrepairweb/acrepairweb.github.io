Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
