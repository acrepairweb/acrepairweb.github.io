<p>The properties and structure of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air.
