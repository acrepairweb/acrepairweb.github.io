<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
