<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
