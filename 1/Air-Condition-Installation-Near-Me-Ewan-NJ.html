<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
