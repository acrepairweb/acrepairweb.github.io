<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
