<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
