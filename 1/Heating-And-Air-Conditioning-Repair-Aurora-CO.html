<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have discovered how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
