<h3>AC Repair Cost in Hagar Shores MI</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>If you are trying to find a trustworthy HVAC company with extraordinary service, exceptional communication, and top notch techs look no more.

<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless splits enable you to prevent the need for a full duct system like most other cooling systems need.
