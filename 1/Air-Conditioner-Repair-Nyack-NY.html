<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.

<p>Due to the fact that things ran efficiently without any sound, I was very happy in the start. Additionally, I saw visible changes in my electrical power bills.

Overall, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start.
