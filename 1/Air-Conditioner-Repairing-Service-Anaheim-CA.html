<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
