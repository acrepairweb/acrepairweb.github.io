<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
