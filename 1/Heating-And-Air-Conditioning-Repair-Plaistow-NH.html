<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health effects mentioned.

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them.
