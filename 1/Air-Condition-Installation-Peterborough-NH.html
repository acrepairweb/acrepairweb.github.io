It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
