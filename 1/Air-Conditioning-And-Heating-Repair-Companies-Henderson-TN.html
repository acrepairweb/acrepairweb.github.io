<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level.
