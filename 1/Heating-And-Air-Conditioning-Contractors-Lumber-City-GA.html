<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards.
