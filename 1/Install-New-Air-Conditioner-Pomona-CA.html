<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
