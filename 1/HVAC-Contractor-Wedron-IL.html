<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we provide guidance to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
