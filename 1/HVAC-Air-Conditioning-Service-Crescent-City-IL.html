<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked within, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<h3>Things to Search for When Selecting an Crescent City IL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
