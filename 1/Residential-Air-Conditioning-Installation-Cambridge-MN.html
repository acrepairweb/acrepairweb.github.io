<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Cambridge MN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
