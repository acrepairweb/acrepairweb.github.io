<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
