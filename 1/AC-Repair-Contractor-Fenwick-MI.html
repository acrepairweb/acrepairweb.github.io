Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Fenwick MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out.

So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
