<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
