<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
