<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
