<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
