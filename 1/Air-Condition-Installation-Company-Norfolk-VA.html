<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company at Norfolk VA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
