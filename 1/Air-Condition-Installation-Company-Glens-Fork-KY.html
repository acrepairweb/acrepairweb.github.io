The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
