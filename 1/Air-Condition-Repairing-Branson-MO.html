<p>Mobile homes are normally smaller sized than stick-built homes and use substantially less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
