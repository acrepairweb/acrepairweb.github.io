<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
