Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation organisation totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a service or seller to do the installation.
