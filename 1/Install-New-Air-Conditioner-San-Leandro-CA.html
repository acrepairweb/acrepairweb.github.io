Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
