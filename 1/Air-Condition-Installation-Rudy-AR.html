<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Rudy AR</h3>
<p>Even more recent furnaces less than 5 years of ages have actually been found as bad. A lot of house owners are stunned to learn that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is due to bad furnace design, but oftentimes, it's from neglect.

The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is also important to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>Because an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
