<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
