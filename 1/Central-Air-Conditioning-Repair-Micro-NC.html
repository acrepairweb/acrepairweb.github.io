<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.
