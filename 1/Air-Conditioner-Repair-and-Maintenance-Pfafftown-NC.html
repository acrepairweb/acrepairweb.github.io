<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes inspecting the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure assesses. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop indoors, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
