<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
