<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in South Elgin IL</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning unit. In fact, you can even Do It Yourself, despite our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air conditioning. Furthermore, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional materials and equipment.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
