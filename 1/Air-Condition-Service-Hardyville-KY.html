<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
