<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Improper adjustment, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range. Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
