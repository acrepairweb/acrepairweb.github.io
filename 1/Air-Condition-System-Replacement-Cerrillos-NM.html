They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
