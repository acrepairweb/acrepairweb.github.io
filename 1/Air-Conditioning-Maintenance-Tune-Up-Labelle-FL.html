<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to maintain and understand.<p>
