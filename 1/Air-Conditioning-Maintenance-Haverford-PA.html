<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
