We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
