<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to offer threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to deal with the situation instantly.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality issue is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex problems-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below may be proper.<p>
