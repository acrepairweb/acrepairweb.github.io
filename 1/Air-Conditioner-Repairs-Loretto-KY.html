<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Loretto KY</h3>

<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation.
