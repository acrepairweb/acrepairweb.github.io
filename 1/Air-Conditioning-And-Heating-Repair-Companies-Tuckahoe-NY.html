<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
