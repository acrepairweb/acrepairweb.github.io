<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Los Alamitos CA</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents.

<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
