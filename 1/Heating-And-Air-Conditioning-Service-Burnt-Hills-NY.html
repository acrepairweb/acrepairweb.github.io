<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
