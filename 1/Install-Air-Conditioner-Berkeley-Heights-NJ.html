<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
