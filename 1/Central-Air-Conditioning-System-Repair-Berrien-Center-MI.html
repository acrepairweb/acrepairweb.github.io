<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not surpass the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
