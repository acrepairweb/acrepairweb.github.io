<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most essential aspect influencing indoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources. Frequently discovered office pollutants and their sources. include environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure supplies; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from building materials, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological impurities from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>If your air conditioning system is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient design. Try to find the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems are about 15% more effective than standard models. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency requirements for central air conditioners for details, and consider buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally take place. In most cases, the belt is poorly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
