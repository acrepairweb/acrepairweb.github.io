<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage. Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
