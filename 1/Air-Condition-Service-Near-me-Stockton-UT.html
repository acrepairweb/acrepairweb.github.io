<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
