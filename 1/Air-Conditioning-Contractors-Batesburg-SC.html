<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
