<p>The life-span of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
