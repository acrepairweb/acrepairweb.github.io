<h3>Heat Ventilation in San Antonio TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
