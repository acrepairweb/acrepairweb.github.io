The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you buy.
