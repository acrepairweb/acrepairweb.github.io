<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
