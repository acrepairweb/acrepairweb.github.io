Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays.
