<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home.

Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Butler KY Home</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter or too warm in areas during the summertime? Whether you're having an issue with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Comfort, Inc. has the products and services you require.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
