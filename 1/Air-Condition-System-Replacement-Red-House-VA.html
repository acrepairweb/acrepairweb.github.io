<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.
