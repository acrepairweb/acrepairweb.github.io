<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
