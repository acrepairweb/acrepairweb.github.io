<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
