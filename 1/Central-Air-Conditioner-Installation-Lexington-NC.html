<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had found the difficulty area in examining the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable before he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
