<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
