<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key part of your cooling is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your residential or commercial property and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage during the winter. The majority of the time, this simply includes some buildup of dirt and debris, which is pretty easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the unit and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to guarantee adequate air flow around the unit.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
