<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
