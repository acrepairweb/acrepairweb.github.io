<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
