I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the concern. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
