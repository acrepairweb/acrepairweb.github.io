<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
