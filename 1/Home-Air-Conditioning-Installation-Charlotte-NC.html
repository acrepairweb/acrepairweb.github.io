<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
