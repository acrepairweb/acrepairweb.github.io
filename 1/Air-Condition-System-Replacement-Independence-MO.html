<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
