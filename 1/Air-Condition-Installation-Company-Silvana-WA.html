<p>Simplify your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To ensure the unit you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These estimations think about things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
