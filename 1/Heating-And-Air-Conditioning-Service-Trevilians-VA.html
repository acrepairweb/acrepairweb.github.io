And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Trevilians VA</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic duty stipulation" uses. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, mentions that a company needs to supply a healthy and safe work environment. Thus, making sure the air is of great quality is the company's duty.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
