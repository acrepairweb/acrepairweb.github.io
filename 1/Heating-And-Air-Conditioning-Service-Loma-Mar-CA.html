PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
