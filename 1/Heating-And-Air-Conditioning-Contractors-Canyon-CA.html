<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness.
