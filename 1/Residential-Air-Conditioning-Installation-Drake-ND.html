<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of a/c, several main elements require to be considered.

The outside unit needs to also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly recommended to set up the air conditioning system units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
