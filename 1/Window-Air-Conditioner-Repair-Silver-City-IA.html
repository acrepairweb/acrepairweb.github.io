<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
