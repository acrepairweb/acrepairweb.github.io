<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores.

More major than the majority of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to set off episodes personallies that currently have asthma, a major respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
