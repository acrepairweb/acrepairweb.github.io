<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
