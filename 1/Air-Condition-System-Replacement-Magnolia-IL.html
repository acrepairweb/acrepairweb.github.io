<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
