<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might search for a heatpump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
