<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
