<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing.
