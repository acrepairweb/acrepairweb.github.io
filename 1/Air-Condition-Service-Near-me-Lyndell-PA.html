<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
