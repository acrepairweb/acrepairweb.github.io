<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost may not be beneficial. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
