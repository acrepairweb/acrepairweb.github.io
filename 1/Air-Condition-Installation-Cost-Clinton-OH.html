<h3>Methods to Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Clinton OH</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, floorings, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
