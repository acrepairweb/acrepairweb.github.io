<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
