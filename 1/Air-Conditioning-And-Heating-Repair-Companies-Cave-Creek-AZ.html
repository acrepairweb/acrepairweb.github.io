<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-term corrosive issues. Virtually all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
