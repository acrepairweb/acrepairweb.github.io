<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
