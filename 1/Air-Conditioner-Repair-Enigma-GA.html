<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards usually total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional devices.

However, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
