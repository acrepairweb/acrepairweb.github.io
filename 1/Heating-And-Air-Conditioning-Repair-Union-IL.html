<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
