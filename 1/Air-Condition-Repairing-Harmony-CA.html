There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic.
