<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air.
