<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Sulphur KY?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
