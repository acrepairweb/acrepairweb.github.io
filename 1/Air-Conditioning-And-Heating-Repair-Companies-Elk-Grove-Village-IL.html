<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

This implies for every system of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
