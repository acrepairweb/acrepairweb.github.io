HVAC experts recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
