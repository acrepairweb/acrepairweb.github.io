<p>There are two main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating business. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when looking for an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c unit: Don't put it in an egress window that functions as the only means of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.
