<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
