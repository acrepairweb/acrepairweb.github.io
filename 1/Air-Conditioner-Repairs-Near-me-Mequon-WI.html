<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Mequon WI</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be set up in all kitchens and bathrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are quiet and durable. Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to guarantee the fans run for an enough amount of time. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
