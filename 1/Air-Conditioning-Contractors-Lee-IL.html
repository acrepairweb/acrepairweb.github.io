<p>Power resources: Verify your access to electrical resources. Numerous older houses have actually limited capability to add significant devices at the level of a central air conditioning conditioner. If that holds true with your house, a ductless heat pump might be the best fit for you, because it needs less electrical service, or for a central air conditioning system, brand-new electrical service can frequently be included. Your AC installer will know what to look for.<p>

Local building codes likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be constantly provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
