<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location.
