<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
