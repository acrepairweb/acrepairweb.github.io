The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
