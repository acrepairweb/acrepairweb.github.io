<p>Sean was really useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
