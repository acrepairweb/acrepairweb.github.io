<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
