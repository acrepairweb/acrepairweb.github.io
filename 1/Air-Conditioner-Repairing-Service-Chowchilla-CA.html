<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.

The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
