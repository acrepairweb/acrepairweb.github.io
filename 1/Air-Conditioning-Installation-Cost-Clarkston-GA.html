<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
