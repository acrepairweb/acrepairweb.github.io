<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
