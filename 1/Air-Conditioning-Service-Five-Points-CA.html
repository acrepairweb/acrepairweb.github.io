<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three tactics listed below might be proper.<p>
