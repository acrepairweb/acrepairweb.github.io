<p>Resideo offers a variety of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System solutions for both new building and construction and retrofit applications.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
