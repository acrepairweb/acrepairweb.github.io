<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner?

Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your ac system won't be able to cool your house properly.

Each option can and will substantially affect your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
