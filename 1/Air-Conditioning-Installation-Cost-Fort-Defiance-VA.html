There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual celebrations.<p>
