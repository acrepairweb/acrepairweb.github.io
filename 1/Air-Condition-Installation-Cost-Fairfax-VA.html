<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
