<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum performance and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. It will have to work more difficult and may overheat if the system is too small. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
