<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer needs to examine measurements of air, humidity and temperature level circulation. In addition, inspection and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make sure it is working according to specs for developing use and occupancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be helpful. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>As with a lot of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary commonly based upon the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years.

A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
