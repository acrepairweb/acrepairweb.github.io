If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
