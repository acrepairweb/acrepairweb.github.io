<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
