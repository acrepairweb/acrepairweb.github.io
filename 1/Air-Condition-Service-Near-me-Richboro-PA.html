<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Richboro PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
