<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Chino CA?</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is essential to keep the system functioning efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be checked at least two times each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
