<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear.
