<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
