<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Cissna Park IL HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
