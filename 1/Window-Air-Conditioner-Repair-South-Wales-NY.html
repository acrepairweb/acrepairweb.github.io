Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a business or merchant to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee won't do you any great ought to the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and employ a certified person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
