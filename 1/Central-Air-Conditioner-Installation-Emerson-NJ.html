<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company needs to inspect measurements of temperature level, humidity and air circulation. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for building use and tenancy) should be carried out. A building walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be valuable. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become polluted with fungi or bacteria and need to be eliminated, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
