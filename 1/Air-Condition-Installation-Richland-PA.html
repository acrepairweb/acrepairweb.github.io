<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
