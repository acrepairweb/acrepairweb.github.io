<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision.
