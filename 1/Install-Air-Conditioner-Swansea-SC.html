<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
