<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with issues. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>If a contractor doesn't have a solid grasp of local policies or applicable local, local, and federal incentives-- like the ones found at the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, they may leave that to you and consequently lower their costs since they have less documentation to fret about.
