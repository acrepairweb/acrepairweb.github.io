<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
