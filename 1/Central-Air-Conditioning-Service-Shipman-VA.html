<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
