<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, stability Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating system is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
