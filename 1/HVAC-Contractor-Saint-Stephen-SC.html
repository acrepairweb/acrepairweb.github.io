<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and offer an incredible consumer experience. To make certain the system you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
