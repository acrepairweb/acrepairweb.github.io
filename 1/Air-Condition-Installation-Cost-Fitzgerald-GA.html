<h3>Finding Greatest HVAC Contractors in Fitzgerald GA</h3>
<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is filthy or stopped up Before attempting to fix any problem, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
