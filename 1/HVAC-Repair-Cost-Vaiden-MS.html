<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
