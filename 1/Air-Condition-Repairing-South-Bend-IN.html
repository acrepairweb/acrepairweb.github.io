<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside. Ac system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home.

All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

"Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and family plants.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
