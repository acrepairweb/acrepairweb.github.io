<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
