<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
