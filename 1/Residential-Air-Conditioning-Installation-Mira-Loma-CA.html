<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, given that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
