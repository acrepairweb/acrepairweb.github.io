<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
