<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c unit: Do not put it in an egress window that works as the only methods of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
