<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
