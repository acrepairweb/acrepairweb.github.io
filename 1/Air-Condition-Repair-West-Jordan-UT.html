<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
