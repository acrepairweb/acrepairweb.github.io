According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just radiant systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
