<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
