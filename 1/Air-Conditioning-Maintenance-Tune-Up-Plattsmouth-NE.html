This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
