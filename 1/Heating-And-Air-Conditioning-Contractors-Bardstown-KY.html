<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
