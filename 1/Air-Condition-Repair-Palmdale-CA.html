<h3>Installation of HVAC in Palmdale CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system seems less like a luxury item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation job, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating system is an appropriate option for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
