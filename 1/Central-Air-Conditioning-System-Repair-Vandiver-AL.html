<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
