<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
