<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Murdock FL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
