<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Raisin City CA</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
