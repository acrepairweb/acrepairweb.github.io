<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
