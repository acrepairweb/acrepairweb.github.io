R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
