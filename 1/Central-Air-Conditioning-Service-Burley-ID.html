<p>A specific a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
