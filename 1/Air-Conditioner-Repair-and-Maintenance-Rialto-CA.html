<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
