<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
