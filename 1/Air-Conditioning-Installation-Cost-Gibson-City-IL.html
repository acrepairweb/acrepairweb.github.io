<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.

Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
