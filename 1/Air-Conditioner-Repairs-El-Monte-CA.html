<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
