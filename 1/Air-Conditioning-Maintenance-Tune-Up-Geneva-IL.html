<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant breathing problems.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
