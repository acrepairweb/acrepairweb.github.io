<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
