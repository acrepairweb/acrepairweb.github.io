<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
