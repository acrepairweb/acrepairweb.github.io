<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
