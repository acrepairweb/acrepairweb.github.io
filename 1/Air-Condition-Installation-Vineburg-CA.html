<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Vineburg CA</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My better half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have actually met in a very long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
