<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The main factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services used. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some makers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire office or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
