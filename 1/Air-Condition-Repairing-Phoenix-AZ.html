<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. As with measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the right size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
