<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.
