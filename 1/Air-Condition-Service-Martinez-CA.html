<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time.
