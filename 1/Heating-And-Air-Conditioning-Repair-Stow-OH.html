<h3>Choosing the Ideal Stow OH Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
