<p>5. Smell good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean cooking area or tidy artificial scents in laundry products and air fresheners produce lots of various chemicals into the air. You won't find their names on the item labels. Standard laundry detergents, fabric conditioners, anti-static sheet, and air fresheners in strong, spray, and oil type might all emit such gasses.<p>
