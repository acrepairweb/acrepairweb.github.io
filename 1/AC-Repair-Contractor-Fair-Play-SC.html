<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
