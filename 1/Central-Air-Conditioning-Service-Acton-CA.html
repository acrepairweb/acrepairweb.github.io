<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Due to the fact that immunity differs greatly from individual to private, it is not useful to develop a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a ten years research study analyzing more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected across the United States and abroad. The building type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples analyzed were checked favorable for fungi and bacteria.<p>
