<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Cashion AZ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
