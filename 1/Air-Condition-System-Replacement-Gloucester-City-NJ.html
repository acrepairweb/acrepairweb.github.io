<p>Expert heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Exposure Assessment Method (GROUP) research studies found levels of about a dozen typical natural contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outdoors, despite whether the homes were found in rural or extremely commercial areas.
