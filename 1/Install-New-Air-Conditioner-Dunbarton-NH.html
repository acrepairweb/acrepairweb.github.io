<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
