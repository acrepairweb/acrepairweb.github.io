<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

An ethical company doesn't make use of inexpensive labor chances even if they're inexpensive. Low-cost workmanship is normally substandard workmanship, and it never assists a company develop long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
