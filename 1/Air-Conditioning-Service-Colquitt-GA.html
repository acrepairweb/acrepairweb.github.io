<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal.

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Colquitt GA?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
