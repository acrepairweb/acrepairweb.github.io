<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Care! Climate Pro is trusted and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night.

Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
