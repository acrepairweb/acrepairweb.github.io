<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Valley Village CA</h3>
<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo tries to find more than just extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's customer base or supply a brand-new line of services.

With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, making it possible for a boosted worth proposal for a wider set of customers.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
