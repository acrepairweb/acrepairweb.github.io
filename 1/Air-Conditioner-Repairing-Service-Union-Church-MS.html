Beware of HVAC contractors who attempt to provide you a totally free quote over the phone, as it might not precisely reflect what they will find as soon as they check out the system.

<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
