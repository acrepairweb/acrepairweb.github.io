<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
