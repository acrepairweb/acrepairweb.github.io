<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
