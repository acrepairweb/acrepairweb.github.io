<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services offered. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's guarantee. However, some makers require regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
