That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or typical home a/c unit does.
