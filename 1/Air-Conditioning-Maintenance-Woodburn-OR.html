As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
