<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a harsh, vicious summer season.<p>
