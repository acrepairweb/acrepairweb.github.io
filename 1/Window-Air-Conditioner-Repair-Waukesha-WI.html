<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Waukesha WI</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heater. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your house he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
