<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
