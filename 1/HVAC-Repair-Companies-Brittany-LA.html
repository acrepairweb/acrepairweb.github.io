<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
