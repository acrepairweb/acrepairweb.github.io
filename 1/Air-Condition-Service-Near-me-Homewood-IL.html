<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
