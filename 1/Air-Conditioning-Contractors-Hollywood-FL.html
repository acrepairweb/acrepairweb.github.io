<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
