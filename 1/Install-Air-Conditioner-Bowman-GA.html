<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Bowman GA</h3>
<p>New air conditioning unit generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating indicates higher energy performance and potentially lower energy costs. An excellent SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally enabled SEER ranking is going to be much more energy effective than your current, old air conditioning system.
