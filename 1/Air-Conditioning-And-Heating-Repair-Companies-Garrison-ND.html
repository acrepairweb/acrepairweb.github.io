<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters.
