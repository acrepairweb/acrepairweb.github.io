<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
