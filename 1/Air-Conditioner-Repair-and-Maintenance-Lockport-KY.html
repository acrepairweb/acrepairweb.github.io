<h3>Furnace Company in Lockport KY</h3>
<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
