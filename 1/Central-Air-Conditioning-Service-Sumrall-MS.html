Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
