When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators.
