<h3>Truth About Honobia OK Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
