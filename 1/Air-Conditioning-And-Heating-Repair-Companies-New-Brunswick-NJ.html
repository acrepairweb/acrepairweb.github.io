<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.
