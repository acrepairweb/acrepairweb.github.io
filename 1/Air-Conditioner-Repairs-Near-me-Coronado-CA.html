<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Coronado CA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
