Temperature levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation must be prevented.

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
