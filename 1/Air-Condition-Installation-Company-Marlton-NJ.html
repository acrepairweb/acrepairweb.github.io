Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials.
