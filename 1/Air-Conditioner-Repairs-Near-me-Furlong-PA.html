<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Gas gave us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these considerable however small changes in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summers and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

Check your emergency breakers initially. You must have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the correct 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect.
