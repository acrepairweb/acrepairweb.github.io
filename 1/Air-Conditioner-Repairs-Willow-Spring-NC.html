<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
