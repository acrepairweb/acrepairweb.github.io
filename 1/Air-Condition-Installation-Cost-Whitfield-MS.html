<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
