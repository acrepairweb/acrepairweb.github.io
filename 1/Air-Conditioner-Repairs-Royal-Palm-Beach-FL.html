In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
