<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

Senseware, a smart building startup known for air quality monitoring, launched an option plan in partnership with other vendors to help customers securely reopen their companies. Molekule, a residential air cleanser startup, launched a brand-new product, now for healthcare use, and received a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Device Clearance.<p>
