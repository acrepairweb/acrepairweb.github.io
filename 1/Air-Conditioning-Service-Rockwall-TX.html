<p>Particular instant impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently hard to figure out if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination.

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
