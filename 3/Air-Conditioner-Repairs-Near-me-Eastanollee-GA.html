<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
