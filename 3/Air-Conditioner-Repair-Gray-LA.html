<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
