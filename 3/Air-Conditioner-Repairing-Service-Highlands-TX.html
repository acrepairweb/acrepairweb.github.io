<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Highlands TX</h3>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
