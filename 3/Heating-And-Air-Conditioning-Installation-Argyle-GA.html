<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
