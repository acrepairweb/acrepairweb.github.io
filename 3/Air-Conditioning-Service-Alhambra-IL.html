<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a way that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.

A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.
