<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>New a/c unit normally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score means higher energy performance and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other aspects.
