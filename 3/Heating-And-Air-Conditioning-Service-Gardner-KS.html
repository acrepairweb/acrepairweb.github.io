<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
