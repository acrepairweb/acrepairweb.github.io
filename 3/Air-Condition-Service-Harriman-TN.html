<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
