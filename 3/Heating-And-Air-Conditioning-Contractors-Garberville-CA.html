<p>Just like many home improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can differ commonly based on the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
