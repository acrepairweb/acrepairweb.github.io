<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
