<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the total system.

<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
