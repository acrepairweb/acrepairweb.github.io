<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are moist or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last task is to evaluate the system to ensure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any issues or problems and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>
