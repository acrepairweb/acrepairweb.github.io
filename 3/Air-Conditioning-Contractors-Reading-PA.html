They offer powerful airflow and are significantly more effective than basic wall units and can, therefore, reduce the number of units needed and this can reduce installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC systems are needed. Ducted commercial-grade cooling systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are normally the most expensive alternative; however, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal systems concealed with minimal visibility.<p>

<p>Initially make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition if you notice a decrease in heat output. Next, examine other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dust, particles and dirt, an affordable fix that can help improve performance. Also, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned properly. Attempt moving it far from direct sunshine given that this might affect temperature readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature level in your home. If this happens, your thermostat will shut down the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You may also need to examine your insulation to make sure that warm air does not get away from your space through different openings.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
