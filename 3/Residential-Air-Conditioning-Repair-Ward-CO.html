<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Ward CO</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
