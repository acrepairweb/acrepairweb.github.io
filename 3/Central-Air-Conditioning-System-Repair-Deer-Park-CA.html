<h3>AC Technician in Deer Park CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
