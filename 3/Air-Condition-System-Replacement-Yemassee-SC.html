<h3>Home Furnace in Yemassee SC</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
