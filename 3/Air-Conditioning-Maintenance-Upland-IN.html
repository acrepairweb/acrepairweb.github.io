Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
