<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in The Colony TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
