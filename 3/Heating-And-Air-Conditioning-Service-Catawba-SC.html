<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
