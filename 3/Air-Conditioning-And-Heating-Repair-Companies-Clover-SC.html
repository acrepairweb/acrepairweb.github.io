<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
