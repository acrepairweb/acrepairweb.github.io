<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Norwalk CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

<p>When you invest in a new heating & cooling system, you're buying your house, your household, and your service. You are worthy of to understand who will appear, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you've employed. We hear all the time about questionable vehicles showing up with people who can't communicate well, aren't professional, and leaves you questioning what you simply invested your cash on.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services offered.
