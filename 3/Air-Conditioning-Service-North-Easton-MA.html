We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning company tends to run cold and hot. When customers require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather shows up, need warms up throughout the summer season and winter season.<p>
