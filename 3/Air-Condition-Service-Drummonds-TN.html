<p>When you buy a brand-new heating & cooling system, you're purchasing your home, your household, and your organisation.

<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building residents might be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning products, construction furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
