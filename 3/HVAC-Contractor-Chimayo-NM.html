<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
