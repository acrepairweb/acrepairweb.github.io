<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced.
