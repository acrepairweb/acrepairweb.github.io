<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is really effective and helpful, particularly throughout the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's house.

<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
