<p>We look at ideas before we provide advice to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
