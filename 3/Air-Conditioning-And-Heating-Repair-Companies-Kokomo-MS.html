He consisted of these minor however significant modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
