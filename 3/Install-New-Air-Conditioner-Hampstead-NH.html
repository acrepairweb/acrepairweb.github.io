<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Houses can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and home items, are similar. Indoor air issues similar to those in workplaces are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, incorrectly placed outdoor air consumptions, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint materials, and auto emissions in attached garages. Actions that will decrease benzene exposure consist of removing smoking within the home, attending to maximum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint supplies and unique fuels that will not be utilized instantly.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outside air that should be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>

Also, housing rates in Seattle have actually increased, and as an outcome, more recent homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Many attics are also being converted to finished bedrooms to add extra space.
