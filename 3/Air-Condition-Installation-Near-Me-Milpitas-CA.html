<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Milpitas CA HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
