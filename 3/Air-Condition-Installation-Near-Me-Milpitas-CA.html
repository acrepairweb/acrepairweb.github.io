<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Milpitas CA HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and associates with human metabolic activity.

Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
