<p>As with homes, the most essential factor influencing indoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources. Typically found workplace toxins and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure products; formaldehyde from pushed wood items; other organics from developing products, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, washroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and printing shop; biological contaminants from unclean ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
