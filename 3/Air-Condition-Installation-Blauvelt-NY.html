Yearly furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace warranty valid also.

Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
