<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Makers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard enters into impact.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than options, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trusted  source of energy.<p>
