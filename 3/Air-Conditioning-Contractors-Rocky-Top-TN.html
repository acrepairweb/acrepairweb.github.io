HVAC professionals advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
