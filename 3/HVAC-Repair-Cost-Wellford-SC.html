After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
