<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Monroe VA</h3>
<p>Even if you do not feel filthy, pollen clings to your hair and clothes where it can quickly irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
