<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
