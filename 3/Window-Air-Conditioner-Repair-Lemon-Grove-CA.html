<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside your home. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less typical now than natural gas, but they can be helpful in more remote regions where utilities are more difficult to access, and in cooler climates due to the fact that it provides more heat per BTU than other options.

They need a tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a vehicle radiator or normal family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
