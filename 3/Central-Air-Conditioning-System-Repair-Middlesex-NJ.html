Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
