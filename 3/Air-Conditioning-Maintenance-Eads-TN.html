<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
