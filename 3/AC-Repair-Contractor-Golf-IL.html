<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
