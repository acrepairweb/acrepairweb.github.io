<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more conscious the damaging impacts of lead.

<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.

<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Camden MS</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c unit isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, think about an entire home dehumidifier.

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
