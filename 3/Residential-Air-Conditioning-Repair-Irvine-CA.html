<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
