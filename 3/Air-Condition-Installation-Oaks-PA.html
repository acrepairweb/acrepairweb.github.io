<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.
