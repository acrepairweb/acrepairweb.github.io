<h3>How to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Antioch IL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
