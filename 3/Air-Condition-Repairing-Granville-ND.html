<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water.

More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
