<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it may work as a path to carry the impurities inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it must-- if particles is obstructing the outdoor air intake, for instance, or the filters are polluted or improperly preserved.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or common home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
