The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
