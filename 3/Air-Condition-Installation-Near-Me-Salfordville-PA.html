<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Salfordville PA</h3>
<p>When temperatures outside start to heat up, you rely on your air conditioner to cool you cool. However in order to keep a comfy indoor environment, you need every part of your cooling system to be working its best. So if your system needs a new compressor, turn to our team for help.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
