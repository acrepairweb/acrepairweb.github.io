<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They met my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile flooring heating unit too soon, prior to the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere correctly, and might void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the substance had actually cured. If you do not follow their directions, and mortar makers might decline warranty protection.<p>
