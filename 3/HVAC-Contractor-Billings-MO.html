These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A/c producers usually make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
