<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
