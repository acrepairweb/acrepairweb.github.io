<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Mount Olive MS</h3>

They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
