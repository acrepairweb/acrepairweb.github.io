<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step.
