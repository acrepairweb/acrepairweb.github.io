<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
