<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
