<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat moved heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts.

As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
