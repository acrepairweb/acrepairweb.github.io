<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be effectively determined or fixed without a thorough structure examination. These examinations may start with composed questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building investigators assess the history of occupant signs and building operation procedures. In many cases, these questions may quickly reveal the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, heating and air Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems installed in homes or commercial properties. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep inhabitants of the structure comfy. Actually every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system installed.<p>
