<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing cracks and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
