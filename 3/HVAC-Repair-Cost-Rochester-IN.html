<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, therefore cooling a home by eliminating heat.
