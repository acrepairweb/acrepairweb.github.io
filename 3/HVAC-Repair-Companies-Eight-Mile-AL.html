<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
