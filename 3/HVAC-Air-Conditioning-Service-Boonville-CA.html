<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
