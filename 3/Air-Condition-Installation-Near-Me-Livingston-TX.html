<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
