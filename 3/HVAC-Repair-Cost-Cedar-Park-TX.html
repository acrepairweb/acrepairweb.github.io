<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
