<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
