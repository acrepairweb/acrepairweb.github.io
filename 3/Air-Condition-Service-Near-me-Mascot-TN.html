<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
