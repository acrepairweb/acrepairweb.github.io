<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not hazardous, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
