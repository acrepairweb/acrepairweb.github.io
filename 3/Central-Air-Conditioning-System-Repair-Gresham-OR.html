Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It may just need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the problem, it's an excellent early solution to try. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are standards; always refer to your owner's handbook. Keep in mind: Constantly shut off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
