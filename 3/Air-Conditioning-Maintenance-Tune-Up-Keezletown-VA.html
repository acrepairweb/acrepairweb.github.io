<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and readily available source of energy.<p>
