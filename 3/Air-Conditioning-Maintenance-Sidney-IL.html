<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Sidney IL</h3>
<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
