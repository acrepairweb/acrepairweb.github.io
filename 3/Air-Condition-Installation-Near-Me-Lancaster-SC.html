<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Lancaster SC</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
