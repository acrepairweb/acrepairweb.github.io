<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
