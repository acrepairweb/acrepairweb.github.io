Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance.

No extra charge.<p>
