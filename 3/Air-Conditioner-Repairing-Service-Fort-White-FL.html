<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
