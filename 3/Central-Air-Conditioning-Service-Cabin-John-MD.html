<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Cabin John MD</h3>

Inspect the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
