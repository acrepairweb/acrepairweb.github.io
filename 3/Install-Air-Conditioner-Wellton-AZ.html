<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the contaminant source away from occupants and even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in building are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences created by these forces move airborne toxins from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
