<p>To determine the right size of oil furnace you require for your home, compute the home's square footage and determine what zone your home is in.

<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are usually short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
