<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad.
