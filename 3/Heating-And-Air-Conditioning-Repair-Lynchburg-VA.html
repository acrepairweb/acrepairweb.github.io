<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better option.
