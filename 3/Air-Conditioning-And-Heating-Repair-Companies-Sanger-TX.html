<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
