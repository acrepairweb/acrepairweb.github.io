<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Holly Springs NC</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Holly Springs NC</h3>
<p>Your concerns or concerns about indoor air issues can often be answered by the federal government agencies in your state or local government. Obligations for indoor air quality issues are typically divided amongst several firms. Calling or writing the firms responsible for health or air quality control is the best method to begin getting information from your state or local government. To acquire state company contacts, call or compose EPA's IAQ Information Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. location.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
