<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and structure occupants might be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the kind of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building and construction carpets, furnishings and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
