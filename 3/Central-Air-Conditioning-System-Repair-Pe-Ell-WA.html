We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit.

We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
