We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
