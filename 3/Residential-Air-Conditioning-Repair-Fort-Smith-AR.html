<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.
