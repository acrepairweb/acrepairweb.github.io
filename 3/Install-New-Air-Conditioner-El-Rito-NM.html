<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
