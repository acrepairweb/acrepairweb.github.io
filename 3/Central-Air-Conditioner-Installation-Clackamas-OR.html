<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & A/c, our company believe in constant education and training at our very own Bob's University. To ensure our installers and service technicians are at the leading edge of HVAC technology and safety, we need weekly training meetings and bi-weekly security conferences.
