<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
