<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
