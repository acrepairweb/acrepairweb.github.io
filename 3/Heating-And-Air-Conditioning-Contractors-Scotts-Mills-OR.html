<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners ought to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps need to not be carried out till these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level all year round.

Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service strategy which normally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
