<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive choice, but more recent systems can be extremely energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas heaters can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
