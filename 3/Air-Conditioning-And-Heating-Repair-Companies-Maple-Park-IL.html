Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect.
