<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source away from residents and even transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside is related to a higher occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC specialists often find themselves operating in unpleasant and cramped areas, at severe heights, and sometimes in hazardous conditions like severe weather condition (to service outside heatpump and heat exchangers). They face many prospective risks, including electrical shocks, burns, muscle strains from lifting heavy equipment, and breathing issues brought on by the unsafe chemicals and refrigerants they deal with.<p>
