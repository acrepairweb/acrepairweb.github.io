<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps ought to also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, citizens ought to look out to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out up until these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
