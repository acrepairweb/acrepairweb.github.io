<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Merely adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. An experienced technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
