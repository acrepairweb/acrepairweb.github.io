<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace since it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
