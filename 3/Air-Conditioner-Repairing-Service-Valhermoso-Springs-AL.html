Such a tool should recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the office; indicate when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; recognize all machines run in the workplace; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Compounding the kept in mind health signs may be task stress. In part, due to different elements of workplace automation, the most difficult components of workplace work are increasing. Health signs related to job stress consist of physical and mental stress such as aggravation, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disruptions, and muscle and psychological stress.
