<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not present a significant health risk on their own, the majority of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources.

This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are becoming more typical as available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages.

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
