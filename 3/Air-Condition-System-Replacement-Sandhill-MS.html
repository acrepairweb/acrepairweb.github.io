By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
