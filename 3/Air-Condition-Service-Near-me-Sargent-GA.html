<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of systems include a set that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee a safe and secure and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, particularly for larger air conditioning system, think about purchasing a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outside house wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
