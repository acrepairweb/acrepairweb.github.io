<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
