<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.
