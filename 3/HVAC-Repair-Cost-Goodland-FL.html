<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this.
