<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
