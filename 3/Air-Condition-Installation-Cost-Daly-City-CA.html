<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
