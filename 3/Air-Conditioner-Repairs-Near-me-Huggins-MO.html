We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
