<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
