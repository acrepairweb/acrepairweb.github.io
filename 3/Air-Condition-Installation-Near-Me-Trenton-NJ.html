<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
