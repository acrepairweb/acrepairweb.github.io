<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, offering a comfortable environment in every room. But ducts that are not set up effectively or kept can disperse impurities from one room to another. Gradually, dust, dander and even mold can build up in your ducts, lowering the general air quality. Work with an expert to make sure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>
