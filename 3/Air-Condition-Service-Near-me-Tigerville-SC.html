<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
