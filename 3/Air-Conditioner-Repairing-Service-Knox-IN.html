<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
