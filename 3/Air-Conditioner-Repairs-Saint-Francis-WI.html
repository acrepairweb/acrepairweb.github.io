<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
