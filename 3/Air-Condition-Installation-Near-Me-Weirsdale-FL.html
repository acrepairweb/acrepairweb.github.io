<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
