<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms.

More recent gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
