<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got.

<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
