<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should likewise be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development.

<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested.
