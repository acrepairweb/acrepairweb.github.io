<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
