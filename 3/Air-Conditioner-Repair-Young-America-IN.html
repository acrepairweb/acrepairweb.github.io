<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
