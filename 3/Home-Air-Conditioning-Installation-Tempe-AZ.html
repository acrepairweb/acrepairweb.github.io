Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.
