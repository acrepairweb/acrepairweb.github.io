<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
