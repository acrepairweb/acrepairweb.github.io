The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as skilled as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)
