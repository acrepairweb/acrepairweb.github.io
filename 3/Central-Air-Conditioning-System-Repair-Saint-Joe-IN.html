<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or faulty wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes inspecting the suggested connections along with temperature level and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
