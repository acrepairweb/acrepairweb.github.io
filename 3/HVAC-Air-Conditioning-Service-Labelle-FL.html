<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
