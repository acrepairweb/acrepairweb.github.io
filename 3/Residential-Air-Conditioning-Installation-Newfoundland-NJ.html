PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
