<p>People who dislike these pollutants need to use allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent space home furnishings that collect dust, especially if they can not be cleaned in hot water.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
