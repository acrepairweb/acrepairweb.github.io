To make sure the unit you pick is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the precise kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the very same size unit you currently have. These computations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually performances rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a scientific method of determining just how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Many geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every unit of energy used to power the system, three to five units are provided as heat.<p>
