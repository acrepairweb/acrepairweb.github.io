The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Makers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new basic enters into effect.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
