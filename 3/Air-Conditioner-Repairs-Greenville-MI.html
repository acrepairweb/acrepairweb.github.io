<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
