The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heating system, you might search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development doesn't necessarily equate to the experience of running an HVAC company.
