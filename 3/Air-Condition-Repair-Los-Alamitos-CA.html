<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
