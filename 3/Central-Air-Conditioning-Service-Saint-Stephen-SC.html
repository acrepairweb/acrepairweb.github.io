<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
