<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Exeter</h2>

<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing combines quality items and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
