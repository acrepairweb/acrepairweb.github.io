He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
