<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
