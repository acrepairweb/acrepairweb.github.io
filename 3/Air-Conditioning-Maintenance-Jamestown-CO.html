<p>Specific immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often tough to determine if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to focus on the time and place the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the heating, humidity, or cooling conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure distinctions created by these forces move airborne pollutants from locations of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
