<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit.

But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
