<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
