<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.
