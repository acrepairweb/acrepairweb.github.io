<p>Expert heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
