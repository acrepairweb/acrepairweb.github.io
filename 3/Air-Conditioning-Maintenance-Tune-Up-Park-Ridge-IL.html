<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
