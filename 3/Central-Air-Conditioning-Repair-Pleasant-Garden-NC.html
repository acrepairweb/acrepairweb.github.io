<h3>HVAC Services in Pleasant Garden NC</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Pleasant Garden NC</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
