<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better option. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
