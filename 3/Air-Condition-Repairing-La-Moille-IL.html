<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
