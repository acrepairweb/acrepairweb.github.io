<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Fremont CA</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic task clause" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that an employer should supply a healthy and safe office. Thus, ensuring the air is of good quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
