<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will decrease benzene direct exposure consist of eliminating cigarette smoking within the home, offering maximum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint materials and special fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature doesn't get too low or too high. To put it simply, they are best for our Seattle climate! They are highly effective, beating out most other kinds of heating systems in effectiveness. The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation usually costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which generally means it fails in regards to roi.<p>

However more complex issues-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack.
