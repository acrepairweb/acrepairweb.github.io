<p>The heat pump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heatpump move heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate climates, but with enhancements in low temperature operation and decreased loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>

There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
