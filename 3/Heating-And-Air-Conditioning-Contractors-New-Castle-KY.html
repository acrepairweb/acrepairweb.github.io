<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
