<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters.
