<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
