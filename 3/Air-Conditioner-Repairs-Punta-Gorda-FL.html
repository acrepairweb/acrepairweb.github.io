These convection heaters are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
