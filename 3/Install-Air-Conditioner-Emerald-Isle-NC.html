<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
