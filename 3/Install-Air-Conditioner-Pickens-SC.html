<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
