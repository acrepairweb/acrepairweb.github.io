<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
