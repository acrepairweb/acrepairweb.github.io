<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually recognized structure materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, however much of the risk likewise originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
