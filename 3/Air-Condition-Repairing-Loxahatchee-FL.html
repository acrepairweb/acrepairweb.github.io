Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
