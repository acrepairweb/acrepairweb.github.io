<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are often incorrect for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and disorientation. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
