This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
