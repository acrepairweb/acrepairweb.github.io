"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced.
