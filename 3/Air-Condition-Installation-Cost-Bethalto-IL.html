<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Bethalto IL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
