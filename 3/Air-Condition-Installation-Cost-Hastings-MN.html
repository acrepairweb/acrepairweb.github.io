It secures the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or toxins due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
