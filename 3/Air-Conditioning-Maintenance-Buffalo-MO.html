Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
