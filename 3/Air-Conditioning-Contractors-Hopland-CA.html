<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the employer.

Evaluation of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
