<h3>Electric Heating in Arrington VA</h3>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, air and ventilation Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems set up in homes or commercial properties.
