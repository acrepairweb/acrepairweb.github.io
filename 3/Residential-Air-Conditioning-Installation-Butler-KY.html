<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
