<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
