<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning unit isn't old enough to validate replacement, consider an entire home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
