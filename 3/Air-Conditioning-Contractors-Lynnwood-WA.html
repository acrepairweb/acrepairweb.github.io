<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main risk of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than many allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>

<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be effectively identified or remedied without a thorough building examination. These investigations may begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure investigators examine the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In many cases, these queries may rapidly reveal the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
