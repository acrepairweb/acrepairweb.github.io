<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Oconomowoc WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
