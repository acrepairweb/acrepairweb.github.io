Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
