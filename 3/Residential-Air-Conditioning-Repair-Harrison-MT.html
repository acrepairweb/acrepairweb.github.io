<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year.

Your heating system will work hard for you, but like your automobile, doing routine and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your guarantee intact.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as healthcare facilities and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as vehicles, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>

Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>

And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
