<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking cigarettes, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing products.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.
