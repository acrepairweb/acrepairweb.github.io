<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Decatur MI</h3>

The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Decatur MI</h3>
