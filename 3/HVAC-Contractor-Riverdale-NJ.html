<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
