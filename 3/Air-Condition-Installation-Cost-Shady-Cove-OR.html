<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might simply need to be cleaned up.

<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling.
