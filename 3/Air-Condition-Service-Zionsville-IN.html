<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Zionsville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
