<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
