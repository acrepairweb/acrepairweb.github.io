If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem.
