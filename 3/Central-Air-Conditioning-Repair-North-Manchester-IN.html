<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
