A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of numerous spaces with one external unit.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
