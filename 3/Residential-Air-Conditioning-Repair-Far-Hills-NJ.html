<h3>Heating Service in Far Hills NJ</h3>
<p>If you remain in the very first few years of company, you might choose to keep your product and services line simple in the meantime. However if you are an established company in the process of modifying your heating & cooling service strategy, think about whether you are prepared to add some complementary sales or services, such as plumbing, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality assessment or system performance reviews.<p>
<p>When setting up radiant heat, you must offer major thought to the type of floor covering in the home. Since it performs and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the room, reducing efficiency, so if you want to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
