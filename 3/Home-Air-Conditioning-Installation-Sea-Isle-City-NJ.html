<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Learn if your local government or any company in your neighborhood sponsors big days for the collection of toxic family wastes. If such days are offered, use them to get rid of the undesirable containers safely. If no such collection days are offered, think about arranging one.<p>
