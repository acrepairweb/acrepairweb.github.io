<h3>Some Useful Strategies To Follow If You Need To Update Your Central Heating Boiler in Mount Washington KY</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
