<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
