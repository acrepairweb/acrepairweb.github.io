The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outside system.

Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
