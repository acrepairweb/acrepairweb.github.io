<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here).

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Inver Grove Heights MN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
