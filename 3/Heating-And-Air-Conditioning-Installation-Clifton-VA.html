<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

In the summer season, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply consistent and dependable heating & cooling.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or normal home a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
