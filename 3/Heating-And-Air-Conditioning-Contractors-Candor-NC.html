Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.
