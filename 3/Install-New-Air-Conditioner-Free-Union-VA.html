<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
