<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
