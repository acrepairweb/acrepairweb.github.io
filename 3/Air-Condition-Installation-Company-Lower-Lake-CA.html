This action is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Lower Lake CA</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
