<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
