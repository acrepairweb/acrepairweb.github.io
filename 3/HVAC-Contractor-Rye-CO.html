<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Rye CO</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran efficiently without any sound, I was really happy in the beginning. Additionally, I saw noticeable modifications in my electricity bills. After two years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. However then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
