<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Camp Meeker CA?</h3>
<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
