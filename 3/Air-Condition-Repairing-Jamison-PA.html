<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
