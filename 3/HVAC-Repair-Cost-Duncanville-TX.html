<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile floor heating unit too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere effectively, and may void the warranty of your mortar item.
