<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
