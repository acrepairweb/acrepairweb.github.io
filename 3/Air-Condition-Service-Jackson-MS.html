<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
