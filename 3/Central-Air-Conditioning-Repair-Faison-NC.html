Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
