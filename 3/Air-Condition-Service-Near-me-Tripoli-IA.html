The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
