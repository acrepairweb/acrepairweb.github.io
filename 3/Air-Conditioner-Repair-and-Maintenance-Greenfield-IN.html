<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Greenfield IN</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
