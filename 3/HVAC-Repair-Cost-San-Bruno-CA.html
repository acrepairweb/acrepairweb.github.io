<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure.

Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in heaps. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be adequate for the average house, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all elements which will influence the right size for your particular home.
