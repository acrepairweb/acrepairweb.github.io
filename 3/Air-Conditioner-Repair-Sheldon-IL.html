<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
