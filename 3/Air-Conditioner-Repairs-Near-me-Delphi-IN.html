<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
