Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
