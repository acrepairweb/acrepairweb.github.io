<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Richmond VA</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outside air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have substantial, hazardous impact. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air contamination among the leading five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
