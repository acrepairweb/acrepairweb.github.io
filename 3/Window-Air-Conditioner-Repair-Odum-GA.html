<h3>Air Condition Installation in Odum GA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same.
