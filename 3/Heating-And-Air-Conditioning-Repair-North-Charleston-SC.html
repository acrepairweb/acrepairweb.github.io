<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to discuss the money you'll save money on repair expenses. You can probably anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Wipe and mop floors window ledges and chewable surface areas such as baby cribs with a service of powdered automated dishwasher cleaning agent in warm water.
