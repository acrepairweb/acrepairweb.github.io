Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
