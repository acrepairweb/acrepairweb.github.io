These firms may likewise need suggestions on which ENERGY STAR equipment is the best fit for the size of a newly built home.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your home correctly.

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
