<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Bahama NC</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
