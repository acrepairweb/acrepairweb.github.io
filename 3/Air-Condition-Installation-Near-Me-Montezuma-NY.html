<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Montezuma NY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital display on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't acquired. There are many different reasons why your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you may be having problem with your Nest wise thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers initially. You must have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the correct 120 volts of power going to the furnace, examine. Sometimes the furnace switch is unintentionally turned off by somebody going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that sometimes goes defective. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are many wires in your furnace.<p>
