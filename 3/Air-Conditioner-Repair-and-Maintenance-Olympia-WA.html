<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
