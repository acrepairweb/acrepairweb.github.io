<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Ashland City TN</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's necessary that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be warmed adequately and the system will have to continuously go to try to heat the entire house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
