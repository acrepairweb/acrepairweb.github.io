Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
