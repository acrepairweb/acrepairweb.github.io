<h3>HVAC Filters in Hope Mills NC</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & decided to go with them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were very professional, courteous and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
