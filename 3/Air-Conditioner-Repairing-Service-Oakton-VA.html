<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
