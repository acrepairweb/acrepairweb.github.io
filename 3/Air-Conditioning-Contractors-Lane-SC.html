<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Lane SC</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be incredibly efficient in terms of cost. If you have access to low-cost or complimentary fire wood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it might not cost you anything.

Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source systems. The absence of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<p>Oil furnaces are generally not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
