<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up.

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
