<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
