<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
