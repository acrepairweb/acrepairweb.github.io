<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Ways To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Douglassville PA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>We required two sees - Jake came out initially and was enjoyable and extremely educated and polite. Grant came out a couple days later and was also knowledgeable and nice to talk to. They both did an excellent job. Sabre's office staff is very handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an a/c to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.
