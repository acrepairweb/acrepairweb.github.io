This figures out the heat get your house goes through. The computation is fairly easy to perform and will expose what size system you require. Proceed to another contractor if the one you're thinking about wants to identify the ideal unit for your home exclusively on experience.

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes.
