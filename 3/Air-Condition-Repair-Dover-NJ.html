<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Producers normally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the same amount of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
