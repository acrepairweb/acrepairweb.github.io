<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce unfavorable health conditions.

Residential systems can even more enhance indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different methodologies. The CMHC research study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or approaches used. The EPA research study recommended and managed techniques used on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered given that these research studies were performed, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a car radiator or common home a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
