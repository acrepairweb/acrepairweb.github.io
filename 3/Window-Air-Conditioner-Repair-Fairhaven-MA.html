<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
