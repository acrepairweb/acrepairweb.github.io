<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
