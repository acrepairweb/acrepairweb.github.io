<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Forest VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
