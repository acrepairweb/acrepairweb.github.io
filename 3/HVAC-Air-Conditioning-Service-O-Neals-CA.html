<h3>Repair and Care for O Neals CA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
