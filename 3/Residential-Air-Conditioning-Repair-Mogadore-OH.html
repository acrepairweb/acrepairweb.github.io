<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
