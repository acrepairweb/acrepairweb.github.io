<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A Trane a/c unit can range in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our pricing guide explains all the factors that affect your cost. The cost of your a/c will vary depending on the size of your house, design you pick, special installation requirements - even where you live and the climate in your location. You can decrease your expenses thanks to local rebates, special deals and tax credits To get the most accurate rate for your home, schedule a house evaluation with your local dealership.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
