<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Shoemakersville PA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I need to state it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
