<h3>AC Maintenance in Ardmore AL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
