<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Norman IN</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
