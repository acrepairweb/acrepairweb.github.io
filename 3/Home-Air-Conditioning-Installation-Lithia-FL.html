<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
