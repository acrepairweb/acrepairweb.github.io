<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
