<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today.

This makes geothermal heating a trustworthy and readily available source of energy.<p>
