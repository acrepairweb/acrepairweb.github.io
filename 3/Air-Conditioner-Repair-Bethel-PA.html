<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
