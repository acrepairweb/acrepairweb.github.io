<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Saluda SC</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic problem like particles clogging the condenser system or a worn fan belt.

Improving those elements may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can impact a person's health, capability, and convenience to work.

<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
