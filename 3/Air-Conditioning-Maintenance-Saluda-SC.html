<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
