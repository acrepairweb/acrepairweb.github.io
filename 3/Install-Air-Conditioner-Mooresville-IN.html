<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
