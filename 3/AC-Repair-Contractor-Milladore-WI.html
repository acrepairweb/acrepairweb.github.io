<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely utilized due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Practically all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, won't rust and can be found in long lengths, which permit PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
