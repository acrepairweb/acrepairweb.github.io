<p>Buildings are created or meant to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

In other cases, such changes subtly or even significantly change buildings in ways that might be important to their own stability or their effect on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques used by researchers studying communities, in order to gain a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
