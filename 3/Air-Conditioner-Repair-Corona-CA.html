The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water areas).

The collector's glass can be washed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>

<p>Buildings are designed or planned to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sterilize, and keep surfaces to boost their look, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps considerably alter buildings in ways that might be essential to their own stability or their impact on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches utilized by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Occupants of houses with poor indoor air quality may suffer signs such as headache, eye irritation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus congestion, nausea, and lightheadedness. Since lots of diseases can cause these signs, identifying sick building syndrome is difficult. Very high levels of some contaminants, such as carbon monoxide, can trigger more major disease, including death.<p>
