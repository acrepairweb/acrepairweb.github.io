<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health danger reason and contractor laws for their choice.

<p>Customer items that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger signs associated with exposure to carbon monoxide.

Use items which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the area is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are usually not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not attain an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used.
