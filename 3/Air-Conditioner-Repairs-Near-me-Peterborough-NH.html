<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future.

<p>When you purchase a new heating and cooling system, you're buying your home, your household, and your service.

We hear all the time about sketchy cars showing up with individuals who can't communicate well, aren't professional, and leaves you questioning what you simply spent your cash on.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee.

And remember that an organisation plan for an HVAC company isn't meant to be a fixed file. It's a framework to guide the launch or revamp of your organisation that you can build on and restructure as the business develops.<p>
