<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
