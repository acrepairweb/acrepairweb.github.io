<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
