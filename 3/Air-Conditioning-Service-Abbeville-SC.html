<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
