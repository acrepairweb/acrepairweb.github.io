<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
