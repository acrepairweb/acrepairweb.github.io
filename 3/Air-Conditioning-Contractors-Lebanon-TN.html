<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas offered us a better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He included these considerable however minor adjustments in his quote. Because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins however the fan does not, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
