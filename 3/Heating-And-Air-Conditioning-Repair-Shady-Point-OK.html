<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
