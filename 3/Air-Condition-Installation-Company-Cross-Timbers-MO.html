<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Radiant heat systems can likewise heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them heated for longer, considering that most floors tend to maintain heat much better than air does.<p>
