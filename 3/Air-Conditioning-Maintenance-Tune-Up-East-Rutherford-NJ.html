<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children might have greater exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
