<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment.

However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
