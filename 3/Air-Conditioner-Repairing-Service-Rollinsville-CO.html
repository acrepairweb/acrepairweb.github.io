<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
