<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
