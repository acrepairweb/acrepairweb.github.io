<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
