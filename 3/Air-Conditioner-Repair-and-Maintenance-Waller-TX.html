<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
