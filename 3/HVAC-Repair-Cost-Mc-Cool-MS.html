<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor.
