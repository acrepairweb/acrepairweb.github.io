<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
