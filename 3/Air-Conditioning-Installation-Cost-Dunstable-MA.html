<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family house installation organisation totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living.

Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
