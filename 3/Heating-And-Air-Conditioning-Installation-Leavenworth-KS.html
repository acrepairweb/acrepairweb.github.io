<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
