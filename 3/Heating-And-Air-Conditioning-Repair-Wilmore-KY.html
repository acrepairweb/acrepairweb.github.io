<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
