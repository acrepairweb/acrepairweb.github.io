Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no consumer complaints have been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active.

<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
