<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
