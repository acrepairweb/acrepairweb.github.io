<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
