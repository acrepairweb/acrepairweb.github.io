Numerous typical structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
