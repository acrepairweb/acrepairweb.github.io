<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
