<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and changed frequently. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will get worse. Inspecting and changing the air filters is among the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
