<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working.
