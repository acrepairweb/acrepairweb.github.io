Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
