<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
