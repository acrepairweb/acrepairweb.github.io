Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone, move to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system required based on BTUs, determining the right size of unit for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
