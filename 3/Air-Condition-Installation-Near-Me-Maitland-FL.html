<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
