Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
