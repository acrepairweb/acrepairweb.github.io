<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house.

Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation service completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months.
