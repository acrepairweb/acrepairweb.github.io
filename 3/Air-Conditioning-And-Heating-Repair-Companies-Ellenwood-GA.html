<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors.

Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
