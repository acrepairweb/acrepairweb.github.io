<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up.
