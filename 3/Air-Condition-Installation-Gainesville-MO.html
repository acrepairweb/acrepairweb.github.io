The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Gainesville MO</h3>
<p>The job growth in this field is credited to the expected boost in structure construction coupled with the reality that climate control systems are ending up being more typical. Also, since systems have to be changed after about a years, numerous buildings will end up being due for replacement units in the next few years. Due to these factors, the task growth for this profession is greater than average.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
