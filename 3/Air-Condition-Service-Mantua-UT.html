<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A split a/c consists of 2 primary parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided a/c unit depend on a set of pipelines to connect the outdoor to the inside air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split a/c installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities tire them from the house.<p>
