<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
