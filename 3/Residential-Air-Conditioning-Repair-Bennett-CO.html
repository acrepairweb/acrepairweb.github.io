<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Bennett CO</h3>
<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Purification should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can decrease the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
