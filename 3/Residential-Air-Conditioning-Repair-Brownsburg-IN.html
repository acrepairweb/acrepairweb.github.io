<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, children, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
