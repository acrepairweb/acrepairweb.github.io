<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
