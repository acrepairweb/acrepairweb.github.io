<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
