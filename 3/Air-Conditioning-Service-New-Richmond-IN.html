<h3>Boiler Heating System in New Richmond IN</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
