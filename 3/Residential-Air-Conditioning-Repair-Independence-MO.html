<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part.

<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the really core of the furnace. Replacing one suggests dismantling the majority of the furnace, replacing the part, and reassembling the furnace. The variety of hours it takes frequently triggers the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a new one would be.

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat far from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>
