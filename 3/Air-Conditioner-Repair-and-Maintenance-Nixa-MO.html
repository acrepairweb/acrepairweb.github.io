<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
