The design expert must consult ASHRAE information for the standards of design and care as the common building regulations offer little to no information on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful referral materials include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>

<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum efficiency and could get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy bills to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will have to work more difficult and may get too hot. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
