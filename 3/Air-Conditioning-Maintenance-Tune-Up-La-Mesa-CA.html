<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location.

<p>Airborne irritants are just a truth of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergic reaction signs, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, germs, and infections likewise can reside in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne pollutants can affect your house comfort devices, too.

<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems triggered by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
