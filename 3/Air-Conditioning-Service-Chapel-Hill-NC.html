<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is an extremely typical repair.

<h3>Repair and Care for Chapel Hill NC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically happen. In most cases, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
