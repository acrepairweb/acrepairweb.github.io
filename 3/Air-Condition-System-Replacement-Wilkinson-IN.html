<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
