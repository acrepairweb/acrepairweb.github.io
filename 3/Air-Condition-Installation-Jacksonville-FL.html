To make sure the unit you select is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we do not simply change it with the very same size unit you currently have. These computations think about things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
