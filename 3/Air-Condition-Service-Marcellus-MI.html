<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
