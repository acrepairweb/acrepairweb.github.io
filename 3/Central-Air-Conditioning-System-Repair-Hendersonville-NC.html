<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>

If left overlooked, a furnace is vulnerable to breakdowns, effectiveness issues, and devastating failures, which could result in severe emergency situations.
