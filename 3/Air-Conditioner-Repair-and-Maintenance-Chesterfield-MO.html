<p>There are a couple of main points that property owners will wish to take into consideration when choosing which of the best AC systems they must install in their homes.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.
