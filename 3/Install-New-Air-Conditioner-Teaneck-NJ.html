A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
