<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Lost Hills CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation organisation entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
