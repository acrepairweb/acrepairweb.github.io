<h3>AC Replacement in Pennsauken NJ</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
