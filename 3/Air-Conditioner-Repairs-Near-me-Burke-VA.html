<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
