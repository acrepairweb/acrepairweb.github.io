<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
