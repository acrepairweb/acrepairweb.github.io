<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
