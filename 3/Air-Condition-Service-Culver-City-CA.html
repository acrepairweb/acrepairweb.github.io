<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous design methods in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. Just be worried if your home is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ a specialist to repair the unit and examine.<p>
