<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heating system, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
