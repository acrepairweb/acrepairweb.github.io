<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of common building products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.
