Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
