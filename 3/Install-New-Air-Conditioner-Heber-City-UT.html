<p>. Prior to selecting the installation place of air conditioner, several primary elements need to be considered. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there should not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be efficiently discharged outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is extremely advisable to set up the a/c unit systems in easily available locations, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
