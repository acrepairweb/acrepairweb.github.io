<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your medical professional about them.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
