<h3>Benefits Of Hiring AC Repair Services at Crescent IA</h3>

These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.
