I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples examined were tested positive for fungi and germs.<p>
