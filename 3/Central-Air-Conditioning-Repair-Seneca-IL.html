<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Seneca IL</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
