<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
