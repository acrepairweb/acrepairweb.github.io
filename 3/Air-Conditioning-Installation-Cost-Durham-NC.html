<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
