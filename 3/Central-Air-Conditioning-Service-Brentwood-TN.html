<p>Oil heaters are typically not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water.

Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
