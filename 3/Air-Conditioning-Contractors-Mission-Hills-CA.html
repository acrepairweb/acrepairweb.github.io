<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had found the trouble area in examining the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had changed the expense to what I considered reasonable before he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen once again.
