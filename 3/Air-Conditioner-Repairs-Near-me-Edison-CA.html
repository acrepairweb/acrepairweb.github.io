<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Edison CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
