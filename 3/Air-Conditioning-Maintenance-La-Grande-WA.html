<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase.
