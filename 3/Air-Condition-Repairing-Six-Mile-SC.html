<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential concern to house owners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have identified a number of pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, volatile natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are very important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungis or germs and require to be removed, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
