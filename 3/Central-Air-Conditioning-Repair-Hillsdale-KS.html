<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

To lower contaminants, we advise installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the smallest particles from the air.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
