<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But many of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>If you wish to save yourself time and money over the long term, having annual maintenance performed on the furnace is an excellent idea.

Your furnace will be tidy and running as effectively as possible throughout the upcoming winter if you schedule the maintenance visit quickly prior to the regular heating season. An efficient system indicates fewer repairs, so you won't need to be as thorough when it pertains to searching for indications of trouble and the monthly costs will be less.
