<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in simply a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy concerns your house he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
