<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
