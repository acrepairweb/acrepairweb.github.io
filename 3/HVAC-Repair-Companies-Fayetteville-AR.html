ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
