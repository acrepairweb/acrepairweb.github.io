<p>Heating is also one of the biggest energy consumers in your home, so property owners who might be looking for a new furnace must thinking about changing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to conserve cash and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts in between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a substantial investment in your house. Invest sensibly by finding out as much as you can about readily available choices.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
