<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
