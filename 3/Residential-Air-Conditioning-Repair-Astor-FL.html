Specialists are typically required to work in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of houses.

<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses electricity, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
