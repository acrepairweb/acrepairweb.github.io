<h3>Passive Ventilation in Waterloo IA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening.
