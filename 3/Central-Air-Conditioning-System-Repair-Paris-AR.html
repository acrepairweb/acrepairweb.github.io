<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
