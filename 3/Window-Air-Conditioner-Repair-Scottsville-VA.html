<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
