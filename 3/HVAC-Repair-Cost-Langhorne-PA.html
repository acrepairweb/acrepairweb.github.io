My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A fan belt, also referred to as a drive belt, is a belt linking your cars and truck's engine to the front mounted devices.
