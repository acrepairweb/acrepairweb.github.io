<h3>Central Heating System in Ashkum IL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
