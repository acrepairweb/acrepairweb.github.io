<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Client Service! Climate Pro is trusted and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
