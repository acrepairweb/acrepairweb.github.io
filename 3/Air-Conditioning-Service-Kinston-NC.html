In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Not long after exposure to some indoor air contaminants, signs of some illness such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or gotten worse.<p>
<p>You might update to the highest performance equipment available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
