<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
