<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation service completely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ.
