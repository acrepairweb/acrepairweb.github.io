<h3>HVAC System in Stirling NJ</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Many HVAC entrepreneur do not understand they require different pricing plans for different services that their company provides. For instance, residential HVAC installation need to be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service must be priced differently from duct cleaning. If you are using more than one service, you should separate these into different departments, as if they were their own separate company.<p>
<p>Old heaters typically start to make some odd noises as they get toward the end of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or squealing sounds originating from your furnace? When you hear the furnace blower running exceedingly, another sound is. These noises are triggered by a range of problems like unsecured ductwork, motor failure, an unbalanced motor or degrading parts. Does your blower turn on and off regularly or does it blow cold air sometimes? This is an indication that your furnace might need to be changed if so.<p>
