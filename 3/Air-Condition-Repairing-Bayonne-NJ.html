<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are generally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not attain an efficiency greater than 90%.

You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be installed.<p>
