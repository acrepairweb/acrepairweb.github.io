<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>It can be the best time to conceptualize innovative approaches for promoting your HVAC company as well when company is less hectic. For example, you may attempt taking part in home and garden shows, exhibition or other kinds of occasion marketing.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
