<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely.

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
