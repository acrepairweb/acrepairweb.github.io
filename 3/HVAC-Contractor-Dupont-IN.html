Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
