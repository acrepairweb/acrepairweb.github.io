<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
