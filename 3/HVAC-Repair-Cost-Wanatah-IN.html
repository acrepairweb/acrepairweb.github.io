To make certain the system you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation price quote to determine the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the very same size unit you currently have. These estimations think about things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
