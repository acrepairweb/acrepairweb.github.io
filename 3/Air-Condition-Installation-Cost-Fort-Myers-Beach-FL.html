<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
