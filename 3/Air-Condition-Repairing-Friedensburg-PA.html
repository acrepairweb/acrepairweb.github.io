<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>

They might also focus on micro-niches of HVAC such as solar panels, water-based heating, and commercial refrigeration.<p>
