Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone.

<p>As with the majority of house improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the house. Many heating systems will last between 15 and twenty years.
