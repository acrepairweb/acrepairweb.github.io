<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
