<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Pine Grove PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
