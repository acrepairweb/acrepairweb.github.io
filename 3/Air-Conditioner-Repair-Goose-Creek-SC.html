<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up.

An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
