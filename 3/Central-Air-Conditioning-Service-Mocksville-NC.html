<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
