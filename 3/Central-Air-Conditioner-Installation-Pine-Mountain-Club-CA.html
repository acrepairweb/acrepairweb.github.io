<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Pine Mountain Club CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
