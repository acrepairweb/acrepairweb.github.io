The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
