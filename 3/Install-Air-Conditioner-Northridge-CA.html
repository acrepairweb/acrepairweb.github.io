<h3>Air Conditioner Repairing Service in Northridge CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
