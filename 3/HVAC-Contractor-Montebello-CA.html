On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part.

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a greater prevalence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
