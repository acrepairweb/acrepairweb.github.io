The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.

<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day.
