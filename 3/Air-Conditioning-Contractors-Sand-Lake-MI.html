<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
