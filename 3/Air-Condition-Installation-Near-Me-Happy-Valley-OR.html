<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. Natural gas. is utilized in millions of houses worldwide.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>The heat pump got popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.
