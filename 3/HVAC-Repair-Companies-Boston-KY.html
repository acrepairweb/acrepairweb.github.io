That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>
