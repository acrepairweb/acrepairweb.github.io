<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Heating And Cooling Contractors in Clifton IL</h3>
<p>The properties and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be taken into account prior to selecting the best style of an underground heating & cooling system.

<p>There is no easy answer, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service.
