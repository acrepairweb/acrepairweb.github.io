<p>A specific a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
