<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.
