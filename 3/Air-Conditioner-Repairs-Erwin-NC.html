Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness indoors is related to a greater prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heating system. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but result in greater energy expenses. High-efficiency models cost more, but conserve more over the long haul. Rates for gas heaters vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
