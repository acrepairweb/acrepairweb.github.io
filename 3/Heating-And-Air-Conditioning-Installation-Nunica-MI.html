<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company should inspect measurements of humidity, air and temperature flow. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to specifications for developing usage and tenancy) must be carried out.

Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofings and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or germs and need to be removed, also. In some circumstances, particular screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a specific standard.
