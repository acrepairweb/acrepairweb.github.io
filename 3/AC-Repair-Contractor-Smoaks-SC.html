<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Smoaks SC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
