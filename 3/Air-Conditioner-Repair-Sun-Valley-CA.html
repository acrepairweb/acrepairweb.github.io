<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Sun Valley CA</h3>
<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants and even relocating prone occupants.<p>
<p>Radiant heating involves setting up coils or pipelines in the floor, offering heat from below and moving upward. It presents an even, total heat temperature level throughout the space. Without any moving parts, it's extremely quiet and comfortable, and it does not stimulate as much dust and irritants, as compared to forced-air systems. It also doesn't create any drafts, and eliminating the need to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>Regularly, however, private investigators will require to come to the structure to carry out personal interviews with residents, to try to find possible sources of the issues, and to inspect the design and operation of the ventilation system and other building features.

The process of resolving indoor air quality issues that lead to health and comfort complaints can be a slow one, involving several trial services before effective remedial actions are determined.<p>
