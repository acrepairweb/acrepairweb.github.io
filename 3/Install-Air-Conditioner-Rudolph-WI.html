<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
