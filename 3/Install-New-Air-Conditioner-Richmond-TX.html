<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning items, building and construction carpets, furnishings and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
