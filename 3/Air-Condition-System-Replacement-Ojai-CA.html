In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of incomplete combustion.
