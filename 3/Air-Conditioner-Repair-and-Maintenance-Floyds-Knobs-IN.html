<p>Lots of people are ending up being more concerned and mindful about their health and the effect of indoor air quality.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
