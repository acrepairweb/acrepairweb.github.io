<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
