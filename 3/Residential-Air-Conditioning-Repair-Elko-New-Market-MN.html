<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
