<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
