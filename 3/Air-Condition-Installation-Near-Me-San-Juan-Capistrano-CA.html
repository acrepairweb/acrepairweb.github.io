<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.
