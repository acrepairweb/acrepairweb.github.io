<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.
