<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
