<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and understand.<p>
