<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health impacts pointed out.

The two operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
