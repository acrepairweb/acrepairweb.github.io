<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work.

He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
