Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
