A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
