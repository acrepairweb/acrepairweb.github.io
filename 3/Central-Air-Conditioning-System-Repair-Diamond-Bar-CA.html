Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
