<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Eastchester</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A qualified technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your a/c is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
