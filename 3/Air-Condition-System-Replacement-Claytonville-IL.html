The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
