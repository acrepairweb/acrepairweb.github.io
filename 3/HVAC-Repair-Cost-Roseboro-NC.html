In many cases, completely brand-new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is dedicated to supplying a work environment that is devoid of acknowledged dangers and to investigation problems that might be connected to poor indoor air quality (IAQ).

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

(See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

Extra weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
