<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
