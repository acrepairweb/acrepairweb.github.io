<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd problem that occasionally shows up. When you do notice your furnace acting oddly, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible.

<p>There are many things to consider when attempting to figure out how often I must change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter require replacing regularly.<p>
