<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding.

Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
