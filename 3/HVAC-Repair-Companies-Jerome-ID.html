<h3>AC Technician in Jerome ID</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on unusual occasions.<p>
