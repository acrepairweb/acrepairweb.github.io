<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
