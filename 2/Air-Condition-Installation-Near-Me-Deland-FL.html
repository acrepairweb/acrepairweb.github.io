<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Deland FL</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
