<p>Details supplied in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services must still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Makers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard enters into impact.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and very large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
