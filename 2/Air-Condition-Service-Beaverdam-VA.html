What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

This is no longer the realm of the lone hacker but rather worldwide, the mob and they are much better financed and staffed than any of us could ever be.<p>
