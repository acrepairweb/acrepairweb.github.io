<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided warranty won't do you any excellent should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
