<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is associated with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly.
