<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
