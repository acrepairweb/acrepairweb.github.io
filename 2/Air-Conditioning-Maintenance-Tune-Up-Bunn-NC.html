<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to save on costs (particularly in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
