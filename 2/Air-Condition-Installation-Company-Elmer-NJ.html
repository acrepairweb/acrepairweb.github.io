<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health impacts discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed impacts might happen.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a high-end product and more like a necessity. (Besides, warmed floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a major remodeling project, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating unit is a suitable service for your specific home heating needs.<p>
