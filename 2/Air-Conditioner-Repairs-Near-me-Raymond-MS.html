<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
