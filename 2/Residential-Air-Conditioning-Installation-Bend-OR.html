Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
