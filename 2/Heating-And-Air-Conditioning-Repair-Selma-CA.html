<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
