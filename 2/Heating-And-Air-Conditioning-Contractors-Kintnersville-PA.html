<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green structure movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all freshly built homes in the U.S. in 2015.

<p>Pollutants such as cooking smells, animal dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors might impact indoor air quality and damaging health impacts might be developed that can threaten locals. If members of your household are experiencing particular symptoms such as regular allergies, other or cold respiratory issues in the house, then it's time for these to be attended to and for your home's indoor air quality to be enhanced.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
