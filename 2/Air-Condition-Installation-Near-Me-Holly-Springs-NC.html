<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on.
