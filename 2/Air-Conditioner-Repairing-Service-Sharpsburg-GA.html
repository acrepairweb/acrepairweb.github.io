<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
