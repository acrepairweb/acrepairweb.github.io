<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
