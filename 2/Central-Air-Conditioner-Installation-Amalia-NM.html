<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>

She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
