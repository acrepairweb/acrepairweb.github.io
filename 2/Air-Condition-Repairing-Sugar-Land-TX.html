<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this information may recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
