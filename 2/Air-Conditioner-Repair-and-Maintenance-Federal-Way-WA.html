<p>There is no easy answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
