<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long period of time.
