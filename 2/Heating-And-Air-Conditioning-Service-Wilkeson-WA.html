<p>Radiant heating systems don't use ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't produce cold and hot spots. All of the heat that radiant heating systems distribute relocations through strong things, keeping the heat near the floor of the space where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them heated up for longer, given that many floors tend to maintain heat better than air does.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

The reward: he is an extremely pleasant individual to work with, and is really eager to complete the work based on the specs of his client. I would highly suggest him for all your HVAC requires.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal effectiveness and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy bills to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. It will have to work more difficult and might get too hot if the system is too small. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
