<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
