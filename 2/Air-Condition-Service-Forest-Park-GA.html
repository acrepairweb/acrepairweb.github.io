<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Forest Park GA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
