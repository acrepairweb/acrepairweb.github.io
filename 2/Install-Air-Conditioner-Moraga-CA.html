<p>Lots of home products release organic vapors that can trigger adverse health effects. These effects might include nose and throat irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, and queasiness. Products consisting of these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, pastime supplies, cleaners, deodorizers, and disinfectants. Formaldehyde is another organic vapor that can cause similar symptoms. Formaldehyde can be found in brand-new construction products, such as plywood, fiberboard, particle, and paneling board, and in cigarette smoke and many consumer products.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly pleased with Stability's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked very well and is so effective that it substantially lowered our energy costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we have needed them for emergency situations they reacted rapidly and solved the issue.<p>
