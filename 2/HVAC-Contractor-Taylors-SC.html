<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Taylors SC</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Many indoor air pollutants originate from the kitchen. Gas stoves release harmful impurities, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.
