<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Taylors SC</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Many indoor air pollutants originate from the kitchen. Gas stoves release harmful impurities, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those very same toxins in lower levels, in addition to other particles that can be easily absorbed into your blood stream.
