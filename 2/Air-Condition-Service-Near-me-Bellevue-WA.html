<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
