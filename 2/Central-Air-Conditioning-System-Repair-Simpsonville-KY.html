Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
