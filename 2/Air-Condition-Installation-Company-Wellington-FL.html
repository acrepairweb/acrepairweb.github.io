<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Wellington FL</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or clogged up Before attempting to fix any issue, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. Get in touch with an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
