The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
