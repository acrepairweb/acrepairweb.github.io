<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
