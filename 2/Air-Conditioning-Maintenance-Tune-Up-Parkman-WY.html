<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
