<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Madison Heights VA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
