<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Richwood NJ - The Benefits</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
