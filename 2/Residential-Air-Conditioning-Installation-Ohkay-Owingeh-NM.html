<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
