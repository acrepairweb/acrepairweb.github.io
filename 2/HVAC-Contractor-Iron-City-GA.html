<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
