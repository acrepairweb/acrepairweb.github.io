<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
