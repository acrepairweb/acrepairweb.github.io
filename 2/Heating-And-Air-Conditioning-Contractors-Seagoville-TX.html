<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one response specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
