<h3>Repair and Care for Orlando FL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
