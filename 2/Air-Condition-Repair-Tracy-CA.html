<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Among the main areas where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
