<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
