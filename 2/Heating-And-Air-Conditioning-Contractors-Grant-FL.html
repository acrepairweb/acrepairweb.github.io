In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
