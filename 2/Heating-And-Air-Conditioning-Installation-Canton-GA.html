<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
