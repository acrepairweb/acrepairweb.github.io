<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and expert. Have been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
