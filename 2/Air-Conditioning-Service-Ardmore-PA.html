<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

HVAC entrepreneur ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
