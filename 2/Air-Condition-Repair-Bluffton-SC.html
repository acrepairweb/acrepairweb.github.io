These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
