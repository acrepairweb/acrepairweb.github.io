<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
