<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
