<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification innovations are becoming more typical as offered services in residential and commercial HVAC item packages.
