<p>Companies are required to follow the General Responsibility Clause of the OSHAct, which requires them to offer employees with a safe work environment that does not have any known threats that trigger or are likely to trigger death or severe injury.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
