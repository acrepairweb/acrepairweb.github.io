What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
