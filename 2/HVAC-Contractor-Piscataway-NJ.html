<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up.
