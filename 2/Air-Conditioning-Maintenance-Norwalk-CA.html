<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
