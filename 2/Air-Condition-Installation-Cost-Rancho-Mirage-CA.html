<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Rancho Mirage CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
