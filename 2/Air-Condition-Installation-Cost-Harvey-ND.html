Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
