<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Roanoke IN</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Roanoke IN?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
