<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Pocola OK</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
