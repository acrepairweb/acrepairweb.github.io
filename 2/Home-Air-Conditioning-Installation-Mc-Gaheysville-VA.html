<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological impurities are moist or wet structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners.
