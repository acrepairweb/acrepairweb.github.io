<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early degeneration, causing cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
