<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
