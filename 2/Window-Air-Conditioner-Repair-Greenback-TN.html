<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
