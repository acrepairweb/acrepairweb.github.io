<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
