<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
