Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Furnace Installation in Cordesville SC</h3>
<p>As one of the most important financial investments and pieces of equipment in your house, it pays to track simply how efficiently and successfully your warm air oil or natural gas furnace is running. You need to know when to replace it prior to it costs you more in repairs than a brand-new purchase or if it ends up being risky. A healthy and comfy home environment requires an energy-efficient and safe heater. One that heats up the home without using big amounts of energy and that does not endanger the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>What happens when you have an emergency? The first reaction of most people is to panic. When a furnace stops working, you require it repaired and repaired immediately-- particularly in the middle of a cold, Ohio winter.
