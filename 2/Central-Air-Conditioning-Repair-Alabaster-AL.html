<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Alabaster AL</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

I likewise have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
