<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
