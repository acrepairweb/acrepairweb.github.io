<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on rare celebrations.<p>
