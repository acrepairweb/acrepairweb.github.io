<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
