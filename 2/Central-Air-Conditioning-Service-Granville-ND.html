<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
