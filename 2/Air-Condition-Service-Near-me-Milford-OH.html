<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to thaw your cooling equipment. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
