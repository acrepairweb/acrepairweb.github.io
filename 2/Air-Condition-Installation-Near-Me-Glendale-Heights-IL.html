<p>A specialized a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
