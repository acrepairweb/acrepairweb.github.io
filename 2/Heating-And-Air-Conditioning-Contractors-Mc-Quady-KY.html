What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
