<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
