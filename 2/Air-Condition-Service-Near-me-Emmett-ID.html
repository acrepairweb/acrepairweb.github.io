<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
