All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem.

<p>Lots of people are becoming more worried and conscious about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including pollutants and irritants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Occasionally it needs to be removed to improve and revitalize the quality of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the air ducts physically by removing the debris from the air filter.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
