<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators.

Convected heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
