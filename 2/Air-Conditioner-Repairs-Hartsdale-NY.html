<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate substantial savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
