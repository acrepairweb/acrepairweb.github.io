<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in New Hope KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
