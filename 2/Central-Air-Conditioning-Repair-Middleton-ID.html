We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
