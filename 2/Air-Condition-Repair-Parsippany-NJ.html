<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
