<h3>A Look At Ductwork At Maryland Heights MO Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
