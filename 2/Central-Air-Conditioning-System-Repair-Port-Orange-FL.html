<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
