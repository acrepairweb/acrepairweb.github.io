<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a business or seller to do the installation.
