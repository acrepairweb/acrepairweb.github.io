They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced.
