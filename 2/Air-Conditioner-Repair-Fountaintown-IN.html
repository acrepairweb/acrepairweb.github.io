<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
