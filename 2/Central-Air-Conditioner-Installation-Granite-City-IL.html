<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, stability Energy was quick to respond. They appeared the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
