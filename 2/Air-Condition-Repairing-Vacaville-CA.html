<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two.

<p>A geothermal heater is more dependable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trustworthy and available source of energy.<p>
