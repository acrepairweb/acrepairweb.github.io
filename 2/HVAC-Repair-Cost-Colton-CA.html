<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
