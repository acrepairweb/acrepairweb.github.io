<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
