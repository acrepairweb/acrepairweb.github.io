<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Brookside NJ</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
