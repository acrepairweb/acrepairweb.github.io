<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in shops to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores change beyond an acceptable variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being clogged up, decreasing air flow circulation, quality, and volume.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be appropriately kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
