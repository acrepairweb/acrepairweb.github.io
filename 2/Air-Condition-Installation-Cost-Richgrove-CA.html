<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office complex such as hospitals and skyscrapers, automobiles such as cars, trains, ships, airplanes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
