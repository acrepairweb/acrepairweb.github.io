<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Luling LA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
