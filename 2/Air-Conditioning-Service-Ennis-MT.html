<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Ennis MT</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. Many home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
