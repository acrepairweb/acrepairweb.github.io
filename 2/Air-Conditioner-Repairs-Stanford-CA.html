<p>In general, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environment-friendly than conventional A/cs. This is due to the fact that you can shut off private spaces when you're not occupying them.

<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
