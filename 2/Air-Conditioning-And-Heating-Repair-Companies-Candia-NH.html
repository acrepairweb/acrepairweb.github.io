<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
