<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Service in Candor</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
