He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
