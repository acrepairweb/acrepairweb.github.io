<p>Recently, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in concern was an air, refrigeration and heating  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of places at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
