<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
