<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
