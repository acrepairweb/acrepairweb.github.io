<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
