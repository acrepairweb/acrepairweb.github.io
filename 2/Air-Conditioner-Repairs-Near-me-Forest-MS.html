<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Think about a whole home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old adequate to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me.

After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
