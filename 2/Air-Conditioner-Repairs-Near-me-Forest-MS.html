<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
