<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were valuable and useful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and situated ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial however small modifications in his bid. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
