However, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
