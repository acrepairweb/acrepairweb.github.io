<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>
