<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in San Luis Rey CA</h3>
<p>We required 2 sees - Jake came out initially and was pleasant and really educated and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later on and was nice and also educated to talk with.

They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely suggest.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation location of a/c, several main elements need to be considered. To start with, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be efficiently released outside and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is highly recommended to set up the a/c units in quickly available places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>The most underrated HVAC element in your cooling system is the evaporator & condenser coil. The majority of people think the compressor is the only part that matters when making a big HVAC decision on changing your equipment. Most cooling replacements happen when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. When the copper or aluminum coils start to rust, refrigerant leakages take place.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an excellent job in ensuring we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were quick and professional, while taking some time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
