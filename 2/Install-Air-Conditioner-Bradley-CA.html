These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.
