<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Cottage Grove WI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
