<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets use a relatively little portion of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the industry's greatest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Car parts producers, aerospace makers and auto makers are all within a couple of cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 each year. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
