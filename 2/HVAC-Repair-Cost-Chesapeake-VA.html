For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>

There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
