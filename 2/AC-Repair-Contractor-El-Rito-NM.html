Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
