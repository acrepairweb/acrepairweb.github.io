As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
