<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
