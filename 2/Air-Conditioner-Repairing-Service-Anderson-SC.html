<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
