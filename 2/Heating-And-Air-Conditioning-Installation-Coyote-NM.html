<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
