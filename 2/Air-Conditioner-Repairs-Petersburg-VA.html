<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
