<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
