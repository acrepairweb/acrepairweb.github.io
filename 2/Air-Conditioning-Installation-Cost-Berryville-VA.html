Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
