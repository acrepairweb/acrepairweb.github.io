Environment Pro is reputable and really appreciated us and our scenario. We came home one night to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night.

Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>

"Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and home plants.<p>
