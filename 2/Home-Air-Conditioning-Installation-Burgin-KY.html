<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
