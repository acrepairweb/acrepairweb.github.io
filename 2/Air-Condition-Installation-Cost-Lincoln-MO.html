<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space.
