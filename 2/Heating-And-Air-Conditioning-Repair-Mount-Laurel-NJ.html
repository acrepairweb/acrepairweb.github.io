<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, stability Energy was quick to react. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heating systems can heat your home.
