<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in West Newton IN</h3>

For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
