If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
