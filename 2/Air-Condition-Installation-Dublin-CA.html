<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
