<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
