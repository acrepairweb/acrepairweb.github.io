<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
