<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
