<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins.
