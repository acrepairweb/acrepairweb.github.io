<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Sand Lake MI</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, enjoyable and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was unbelievable, informative and useful - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were polite and diligent. The work site was left utterly cleared and cleaned. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Many AC systems feature a number of unique functions that can even more improve performance and efficiency.
