<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
