<p>We look at hints before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
