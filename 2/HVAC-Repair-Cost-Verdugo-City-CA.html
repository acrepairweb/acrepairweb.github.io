One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to withstand existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be effectively determined or corrected without a comprehensive building investigation. These investigations might start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives assess the history of resident symptoms and building operation procedures.
