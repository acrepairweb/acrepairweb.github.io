<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
