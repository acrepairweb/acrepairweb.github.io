<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians believed they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
