<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
