<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of home heating-- convection.

<p>Many commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, useful and informative - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were conscientious and polite. The work site was left utterly cleared and cleaned up. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
