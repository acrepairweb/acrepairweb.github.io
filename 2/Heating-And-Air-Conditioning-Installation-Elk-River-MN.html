Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these devices). I have absolutely nothing but great things to state - he has actually taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
