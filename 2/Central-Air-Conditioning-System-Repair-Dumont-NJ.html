<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
