<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
