<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>
