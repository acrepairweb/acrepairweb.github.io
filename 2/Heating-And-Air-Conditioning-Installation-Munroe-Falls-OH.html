<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
