Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

Excess moisture can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, unequal temperature level regulation, germs, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to guarantee all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
