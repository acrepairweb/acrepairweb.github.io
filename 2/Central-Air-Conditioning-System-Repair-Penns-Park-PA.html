<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.
