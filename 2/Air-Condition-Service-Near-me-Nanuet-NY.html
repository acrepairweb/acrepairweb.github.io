Then yank the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Nanuet NY</h3>
<p>The exhaust outlets enable all harmful gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are blocked. The technician will evaluate all of these elements of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
