<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources.
