<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
