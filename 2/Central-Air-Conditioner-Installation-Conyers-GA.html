<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
