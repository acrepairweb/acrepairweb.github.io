<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
