<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
