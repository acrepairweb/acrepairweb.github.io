<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts suggests you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
