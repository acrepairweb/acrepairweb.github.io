<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
