<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness inside is related to a higher occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
