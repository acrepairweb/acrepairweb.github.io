<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Willow Creek MT?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
