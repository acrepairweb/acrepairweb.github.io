<p>Picking the right size air conditioning system is a crucial part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to assist you with. Here's why buying the right size air conditioner matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up squandering cash and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
