<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
