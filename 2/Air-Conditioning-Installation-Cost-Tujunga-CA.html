If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
