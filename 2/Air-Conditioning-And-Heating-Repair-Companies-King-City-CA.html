<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
