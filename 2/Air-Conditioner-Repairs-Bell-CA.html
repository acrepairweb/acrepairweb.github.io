<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants or even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Picking the best size air conditioning unit is a crucial part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why buying the right size a/c matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll wind up losing money and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
