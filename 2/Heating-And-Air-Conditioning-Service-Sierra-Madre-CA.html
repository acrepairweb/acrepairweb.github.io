<h2>How To Hire HVAC Companies in Sierra Madre</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
