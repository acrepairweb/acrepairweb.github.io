Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house.

Evaluation of this data might recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
