<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
