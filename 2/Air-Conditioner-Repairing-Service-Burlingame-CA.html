<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
