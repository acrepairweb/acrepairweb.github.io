<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Fairview Heights IL</h3>
<p>Sean was really handy. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
