Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

No charge for the see or the new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
