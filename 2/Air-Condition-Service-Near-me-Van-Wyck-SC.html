<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects throughout summer seasons. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned completely before colder seasons start. Always make sure that the furnace is cleaned up annually to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working effectively. If your furnace remains in a very bad condition, possibly it is time to begin considering purchasing a new one.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
