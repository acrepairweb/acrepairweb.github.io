<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Goldsmith IN</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
