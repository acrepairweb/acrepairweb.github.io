<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the model you purchase. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices. This indicates it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>

She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
