Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
