<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
