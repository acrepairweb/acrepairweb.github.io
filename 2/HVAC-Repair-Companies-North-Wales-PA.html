<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in produced items. For instance, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
