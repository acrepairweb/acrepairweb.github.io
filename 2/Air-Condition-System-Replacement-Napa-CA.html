<p>Professional heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
