<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
