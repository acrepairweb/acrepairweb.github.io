<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne.
