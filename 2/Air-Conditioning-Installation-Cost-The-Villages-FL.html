<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in The Villages</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators used combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
