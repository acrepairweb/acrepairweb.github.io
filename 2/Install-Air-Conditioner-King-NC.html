<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for King NC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
