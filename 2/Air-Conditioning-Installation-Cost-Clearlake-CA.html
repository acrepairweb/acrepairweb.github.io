Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
