<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.
