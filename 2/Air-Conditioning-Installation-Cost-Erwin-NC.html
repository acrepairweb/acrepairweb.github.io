<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day.

I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we provide guidance to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
