<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be set up in a new structure. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the cooling and heating requirements for your home and is crucial iin ensuring the performance and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup must suffice for the typical house, however house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will affect the correct size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
