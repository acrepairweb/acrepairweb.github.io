<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This need to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
