<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your furnace stops working, start by calling RJ Heating. We often discover that a simple repair or change is all that's needed to help it run properly once again. Much more typically, our clients are surprised that we more than happy to fix a furnace instead of attempting to offer them a brand-new one. Sure, that unusual odor or grinding sound may seem severe, however not to our competent service technicians-- they know precisely how to handle heating issues and ensure safe operation without scaring or overselling you on something you do not require.<p>

Exceptionally high levels of some pollutants, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more severe health problem, consisting of death.<p>
