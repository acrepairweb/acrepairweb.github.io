<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
