<h3>Furnace Repair in Sheridan MI</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
