<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and expert.

<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than models made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years old or older.

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Gwynedd PA</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen.

It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me.
