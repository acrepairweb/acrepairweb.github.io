<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>

Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the three methods below might be suitable.<p>
