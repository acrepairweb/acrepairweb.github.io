It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
