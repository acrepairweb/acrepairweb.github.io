<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Sheldon SC</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same).
