<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
