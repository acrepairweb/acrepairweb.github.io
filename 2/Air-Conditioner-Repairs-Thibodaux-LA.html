<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried.
