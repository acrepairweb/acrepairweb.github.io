<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
