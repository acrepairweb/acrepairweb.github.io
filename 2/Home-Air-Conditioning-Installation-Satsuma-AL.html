<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
