<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
