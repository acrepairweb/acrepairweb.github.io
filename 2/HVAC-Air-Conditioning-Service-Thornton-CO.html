<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
