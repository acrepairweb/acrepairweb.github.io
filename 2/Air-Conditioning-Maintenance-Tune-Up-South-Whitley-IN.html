<p>There are a great deal of advantages to utilizing a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heating system.

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse.

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
