<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
