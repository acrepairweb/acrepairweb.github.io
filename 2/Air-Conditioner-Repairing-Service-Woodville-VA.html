Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
