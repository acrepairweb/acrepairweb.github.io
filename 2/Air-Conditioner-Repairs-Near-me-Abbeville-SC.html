<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
