<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
