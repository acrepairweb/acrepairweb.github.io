<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building materials, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the danger also comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me.
