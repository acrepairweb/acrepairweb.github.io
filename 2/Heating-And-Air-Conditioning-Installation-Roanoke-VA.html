<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install.
