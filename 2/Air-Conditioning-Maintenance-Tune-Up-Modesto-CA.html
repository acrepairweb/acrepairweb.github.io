For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
