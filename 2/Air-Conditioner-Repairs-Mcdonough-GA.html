<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents might be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building carpets, activities and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
