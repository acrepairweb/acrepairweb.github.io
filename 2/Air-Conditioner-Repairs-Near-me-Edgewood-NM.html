<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.

Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
