<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
