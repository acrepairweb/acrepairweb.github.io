<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Ventilation System in Dayton VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
