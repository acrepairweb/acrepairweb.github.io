<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Travelers Rest SC</h3>

They both did a terrific job. Sabre's workplace personnel is extremely handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly suggest.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
