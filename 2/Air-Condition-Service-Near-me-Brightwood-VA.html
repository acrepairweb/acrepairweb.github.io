<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts.

<p>Its special feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to numerous indoor systems.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
