<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and ought to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
