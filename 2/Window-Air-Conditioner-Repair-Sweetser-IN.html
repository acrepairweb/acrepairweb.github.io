<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
