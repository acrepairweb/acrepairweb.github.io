<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my stuff. I like my devices and appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So buying this a/c unit to change my old one was somewhat of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am glad I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in excellent manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got given that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
