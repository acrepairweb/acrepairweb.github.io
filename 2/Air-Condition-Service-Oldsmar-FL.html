<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided great customer service at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It is not practical to create a universal guideline fit for all in terms of exposure and health because resistance varies greatly from individual to private. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years study analyzing more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type consisted of both commercial and residential. The majority of samples examined were evaluated favorable for germs and fungi.<p>
