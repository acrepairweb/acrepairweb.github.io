<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
