<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, since it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to carry the heat to the rooms.

The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
