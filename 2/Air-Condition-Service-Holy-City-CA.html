Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
