<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
