<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
