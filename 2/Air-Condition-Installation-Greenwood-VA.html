<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
