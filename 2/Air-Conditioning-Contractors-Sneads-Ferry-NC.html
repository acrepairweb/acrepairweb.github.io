<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working.
