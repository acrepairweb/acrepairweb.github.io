<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
