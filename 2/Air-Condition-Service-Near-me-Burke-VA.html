<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Burke VA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
