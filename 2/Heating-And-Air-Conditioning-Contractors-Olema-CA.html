<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
