<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue.

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Montebello CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
