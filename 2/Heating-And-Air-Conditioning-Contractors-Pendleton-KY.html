It is extremely essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do notice your furnace acting strangely.

<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread out these contaminants throughout the house.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Furthermore, house owners have a range of options to select from in powering a floor heater. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
