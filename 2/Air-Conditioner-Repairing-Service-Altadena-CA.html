<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
