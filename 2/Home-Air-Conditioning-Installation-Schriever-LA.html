<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
