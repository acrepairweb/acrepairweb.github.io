<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
