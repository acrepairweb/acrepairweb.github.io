<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
