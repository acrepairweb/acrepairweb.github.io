<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Troy VA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in cooler climates were warmed by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floors, ceilings and walls heated. In turn, the things in the space, like furnishings and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
