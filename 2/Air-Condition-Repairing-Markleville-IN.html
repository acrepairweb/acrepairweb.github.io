<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
