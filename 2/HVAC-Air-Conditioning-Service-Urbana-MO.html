<p>If you have a big house, a house with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Homeowners would be well advised to carry out a home energy audit to evaluate where enhancements might be made to increase the effectiveness of an existing HVAC system.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
