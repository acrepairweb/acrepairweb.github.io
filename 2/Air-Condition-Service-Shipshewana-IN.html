<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered terrific customer support at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
