<p>Oil heaters are typically not extremely effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not achieve an effectiveness greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
