<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same.
