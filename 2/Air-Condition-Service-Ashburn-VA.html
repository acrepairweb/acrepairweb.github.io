<h3>AC Replacement in Ashburn VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
