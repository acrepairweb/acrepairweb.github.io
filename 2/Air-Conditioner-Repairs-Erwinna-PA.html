<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
