This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>You must always employ an expert to carry out AC repair, for the very same factor that you rely on a professional plumbing technician or electrical expert. You do not conduct repairs on your own pipes system, or change your own electrical grid. The factors that you do not do those things are apparent. You don't have the tools, or the competence, to be sure that you perform those procedures safely and correctly. Professionals, however, do have the tools and knowledge to do the task correctly. Cooling repair is no various. You always want to work with a professional to repair your system, so you can have the peace of mind associated trusting a specialist in the field.<p>

<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
