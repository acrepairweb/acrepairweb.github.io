<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Columbia MS</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to assess scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from starting to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
