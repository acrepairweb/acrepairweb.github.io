<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
