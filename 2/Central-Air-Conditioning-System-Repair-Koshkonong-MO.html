That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
