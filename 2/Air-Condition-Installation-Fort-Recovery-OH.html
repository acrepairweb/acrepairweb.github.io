<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.

In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Several efforts envisage to reduce indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from products. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems consisting of low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, in addition to California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the USA. These efforts altered the marketplace where an increasing variety of low-emitting products has appeared during the last decades.<p>
<p>Additionally, homeowners have a variety of options to select from in powering a flooring heating unit. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
