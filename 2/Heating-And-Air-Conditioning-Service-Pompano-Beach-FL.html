<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
