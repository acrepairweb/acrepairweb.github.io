<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
