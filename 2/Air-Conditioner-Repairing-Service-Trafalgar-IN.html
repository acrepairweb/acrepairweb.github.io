<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
