Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
