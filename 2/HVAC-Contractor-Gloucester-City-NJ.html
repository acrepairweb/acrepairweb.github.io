<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
