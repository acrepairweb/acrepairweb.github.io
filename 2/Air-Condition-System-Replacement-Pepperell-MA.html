<h3>Radiant Heating System in Pepperell MA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
