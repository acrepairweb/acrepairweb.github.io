<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
