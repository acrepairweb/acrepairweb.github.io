Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider.

Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
