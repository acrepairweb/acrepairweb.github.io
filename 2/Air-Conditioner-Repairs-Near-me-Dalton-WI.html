<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are hardly ever utilized due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Virtually all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which enable PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
