<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
