<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
