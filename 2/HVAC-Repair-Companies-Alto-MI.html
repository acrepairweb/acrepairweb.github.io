But in order to maintain a comfortable indoor environment, you need every component of your cooling system to be working its finest. So if your unit requires a brand-new compressor, rely on our group for help. At Around the Clock A/c & Heating, Inc., we supply trustworthy cooling compressor installation services for residential and commercial customers in Rye Brook, NY.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
