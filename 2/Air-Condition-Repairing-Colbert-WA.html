<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.
