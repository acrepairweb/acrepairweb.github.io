<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
<p>It is especially important to take as much of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating systems, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
