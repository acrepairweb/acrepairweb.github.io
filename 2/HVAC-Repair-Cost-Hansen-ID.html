<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Hansen ID</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
