<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide contracts.. The so called trusted companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night outfits.

They walk in with or without a contract and start offering you things you don't need. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a consultant to validate the so called treatments and problems. 9 out of 10, I examine are completely wrong.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
