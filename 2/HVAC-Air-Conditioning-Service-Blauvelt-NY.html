<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
