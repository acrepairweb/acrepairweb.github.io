<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the issue and repaired really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They met my needs totally by providing an expert quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't necessarily equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. When consumers need their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here, need heats up throughout the summer season and winter.<p>
