<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
