<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
