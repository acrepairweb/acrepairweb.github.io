<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
