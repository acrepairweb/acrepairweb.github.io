<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to preserving a correct temperature.<p>
<p>Since they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
