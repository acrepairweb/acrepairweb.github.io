<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
