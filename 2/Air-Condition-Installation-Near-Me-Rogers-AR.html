<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After contacting Integrity we were offered a terrific quote on a radiant flooring system.

<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
