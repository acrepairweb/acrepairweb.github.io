Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release pollutants more or less constantly.

<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
