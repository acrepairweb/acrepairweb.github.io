<p>In a lot of cases, if products have actually stopped working to dry out several days after the believed water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable. Through a mold investigation, which may include harmful examination, one should be able to determine the existence or absence of mold. In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation may be required. Mold testing and inspections should be performed by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to guarantee precise outcomes; totally free mold screening offered by removal companies is not recommended.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can create a lot of water due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
