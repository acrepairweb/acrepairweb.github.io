<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
