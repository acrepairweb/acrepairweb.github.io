By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be performed in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed.

<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences.
