<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
