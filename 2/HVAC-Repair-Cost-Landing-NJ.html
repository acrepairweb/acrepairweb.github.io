<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
