<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
