<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal service. A carefully crafted organisation plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to manage those lulls and peaks so your revenues remain healthy year-round.

By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
