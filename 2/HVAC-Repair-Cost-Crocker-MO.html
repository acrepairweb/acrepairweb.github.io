<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Crocker MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system.
