<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
