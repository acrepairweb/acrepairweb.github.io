<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
