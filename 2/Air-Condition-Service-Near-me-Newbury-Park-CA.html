<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
