<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might end up being blocked, reducing air flow quality, volume, and distribution. They also might become places for bacteria and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be appropriately preserved to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
