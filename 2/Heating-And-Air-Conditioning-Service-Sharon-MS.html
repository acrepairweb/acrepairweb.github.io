<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
