<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
