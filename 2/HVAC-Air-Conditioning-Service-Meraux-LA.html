<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (houses normally use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
