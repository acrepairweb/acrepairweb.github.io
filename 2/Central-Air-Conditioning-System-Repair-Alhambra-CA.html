<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
