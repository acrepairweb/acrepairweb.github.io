HVAC experts advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>

No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication.

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
