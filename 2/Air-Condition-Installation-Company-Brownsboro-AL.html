<h3>Gas Central Heating in Brownsboro AL</h3>
<p>While individuals spend 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a big focus of attention for facilities management and occupants up until just recently.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
