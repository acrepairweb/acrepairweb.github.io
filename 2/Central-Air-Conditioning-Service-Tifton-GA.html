<p>Usually the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate issues-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the three tactics listed below might be suitable.<p>
