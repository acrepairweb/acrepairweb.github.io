<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Philo CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
