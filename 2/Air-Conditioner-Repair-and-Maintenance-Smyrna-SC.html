<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
