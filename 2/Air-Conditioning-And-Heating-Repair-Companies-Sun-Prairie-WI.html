<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
