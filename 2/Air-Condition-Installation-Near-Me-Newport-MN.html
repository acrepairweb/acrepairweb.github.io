<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here).

<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Toxins might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below.
