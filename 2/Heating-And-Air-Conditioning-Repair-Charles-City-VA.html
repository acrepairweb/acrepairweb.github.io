<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Charles City VA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
