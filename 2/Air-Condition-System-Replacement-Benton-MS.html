<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Benton MS</h3>

Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.
