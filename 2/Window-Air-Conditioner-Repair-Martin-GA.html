Compare the different furnace performance rankings recommended by the individual contractors to pick the design and system that finest matches your energy requires. Keep in mind that energy-star rated devices will conserve you cash in the end but might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
