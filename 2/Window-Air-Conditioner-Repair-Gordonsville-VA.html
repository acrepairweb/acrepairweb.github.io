<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Gordonsville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
