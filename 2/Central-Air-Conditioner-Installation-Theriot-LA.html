Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Theriot LA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
