<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear greater than normal, it is probably time to think about a new system.

<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Evaluation Approach (TEAM) research studies found levels of about a dozen typical organic contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, despite whether the homes were found in highly industrial or rural locations. Additional TEAM studies show that while individuals are using items consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
