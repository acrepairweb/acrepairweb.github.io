CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

In addition to commercial and residential cooling and heating services, our local groups offer other services, including carbon monoxide and smoke alarm installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality solutions such as air filtration services and installation of dehumidifiers and humidifiers.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a variety of special functions that can further enhance efficiency and efficiency. For instance, house owners may want to try to find one that comes with an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to decrease energy costs much more. Of course, more features indicate greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
