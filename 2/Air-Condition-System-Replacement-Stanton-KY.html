<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
