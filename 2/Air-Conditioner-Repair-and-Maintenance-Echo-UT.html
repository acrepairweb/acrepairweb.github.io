Damaging direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
