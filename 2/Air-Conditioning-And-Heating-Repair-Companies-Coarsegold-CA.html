<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
