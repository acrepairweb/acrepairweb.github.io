<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
