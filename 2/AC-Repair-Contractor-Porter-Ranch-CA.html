<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
