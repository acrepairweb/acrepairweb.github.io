In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance.

No additional charge.<p>
