A/c unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the right temperature level.

Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should call in an expert to examine and repair the unit.<p>
