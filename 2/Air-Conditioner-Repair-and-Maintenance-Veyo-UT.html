<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
