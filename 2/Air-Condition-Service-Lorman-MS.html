<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

To put it simply, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of convenience.
