Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Ionia MI</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic duty stipulation" applies. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should offer a healthy and safe office. Therefore, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's duty.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
