<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Castleton VA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
