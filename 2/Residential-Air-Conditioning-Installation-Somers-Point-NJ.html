What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
