<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Environment Pro is trustworthy and really appreciated us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
