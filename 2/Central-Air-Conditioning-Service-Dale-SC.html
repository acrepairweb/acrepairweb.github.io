<p>Increasing energy costs are not the only factor for high expenses. Furnaces typically lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have not been correctly preserved. As a result your oil or gas furnace may run longer to provide the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy costs to increase. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be utilized to help you spend for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your recent heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a considerable distinction.<p>

<p>You could update to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air leaves the system.<p>
