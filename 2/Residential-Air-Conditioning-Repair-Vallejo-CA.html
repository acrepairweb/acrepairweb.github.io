<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
