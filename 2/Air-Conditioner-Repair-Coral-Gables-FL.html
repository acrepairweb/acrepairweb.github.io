Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
