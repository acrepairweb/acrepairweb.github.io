<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
