<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may become very dirty. These aspects of the equipment are crucial for efficient air conditioning.

For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
