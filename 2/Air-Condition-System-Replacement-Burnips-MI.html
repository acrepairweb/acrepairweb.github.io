<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
