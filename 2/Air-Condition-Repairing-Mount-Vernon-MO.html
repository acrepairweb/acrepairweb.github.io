<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Mount Vernon MO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the building. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>

<h3>HVAC Services Near Me in Mount Vernon MO</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
