<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
