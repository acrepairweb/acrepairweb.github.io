<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
