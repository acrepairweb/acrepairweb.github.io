<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
