<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.
