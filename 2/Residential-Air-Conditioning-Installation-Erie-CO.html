<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
