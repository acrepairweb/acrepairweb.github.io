<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house.

The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
