<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>

<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Norene TN</h3>
<p>When you need expert heating, cooling, or indoor air quality, call Raleigh Heating & Air. Beginning in 1992, Raleigh Heating & Air has been serving house owners in the Raleigh Location.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
