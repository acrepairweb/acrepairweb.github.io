<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

<p>The most typical kind of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey option, but more recent systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective gas heaters can achieve AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure."

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
