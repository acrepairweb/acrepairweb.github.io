<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Unclean Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, pet hair and other particles result in problems like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. Do It Yourself filter replacement choices range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. If the technician comes to your home, that may be a really pricey dirty-filter medical diagnosis.
