<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really comprehensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn supplied excellent customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
