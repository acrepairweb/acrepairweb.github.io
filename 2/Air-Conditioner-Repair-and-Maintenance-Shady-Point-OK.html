<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
