<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.
