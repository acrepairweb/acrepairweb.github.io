<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
