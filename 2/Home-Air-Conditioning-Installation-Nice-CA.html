<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

Atmospheric pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
