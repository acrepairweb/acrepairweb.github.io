<h3>Heating Service in Blue Springs MO</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can collect and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothes and devices brought house from task websites.<p>
