<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Keene TX?</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
