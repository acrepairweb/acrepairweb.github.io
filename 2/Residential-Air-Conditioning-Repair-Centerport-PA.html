<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air).
