<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
