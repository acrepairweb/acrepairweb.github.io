<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Farmington MN</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some human beings exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
