<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
