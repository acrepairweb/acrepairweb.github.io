<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These should be taken into account before picking the best design of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with favorable heat transfer residential or commercial properties needs less pipelines to achieve the wanted underground cooling and heating result, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
