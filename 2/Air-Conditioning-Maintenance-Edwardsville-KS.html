<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
