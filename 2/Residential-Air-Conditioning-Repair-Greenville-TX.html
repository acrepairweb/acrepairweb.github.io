<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
