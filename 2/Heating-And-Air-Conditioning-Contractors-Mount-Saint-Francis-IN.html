<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

If it becomes damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
