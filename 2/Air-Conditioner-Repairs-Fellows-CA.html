<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Fellows CA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
