<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
