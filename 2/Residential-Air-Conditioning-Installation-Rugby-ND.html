<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
