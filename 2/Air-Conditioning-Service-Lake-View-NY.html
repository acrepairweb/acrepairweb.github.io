<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature level doesn't get too low or too high.
