<p>In general, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than standard A/cs. Since you can turn off specific rooms when you're not inhabiting them, this is.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly.
