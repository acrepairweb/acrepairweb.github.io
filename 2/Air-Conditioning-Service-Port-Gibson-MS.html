<h3>Solar Heating System in Port Gibson MS</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
