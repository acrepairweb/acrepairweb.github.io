<p>Info supplied in this safety guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies.

Makers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise worsen indoor air quality problems.
