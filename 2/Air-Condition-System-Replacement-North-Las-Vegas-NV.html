Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
