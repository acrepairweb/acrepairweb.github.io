<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
