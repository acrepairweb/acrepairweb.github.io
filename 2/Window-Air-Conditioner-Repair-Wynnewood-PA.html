<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological contaminant. Biological impurities in the home might include mold, germs, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause contagious illness such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Symptoms triggered by biological contaminants include sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, lightheadedness, and respiratory infections.<p>
