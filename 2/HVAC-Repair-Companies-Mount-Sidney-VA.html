Forced air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output.

<p>Heating systems as they age risk of developing cracks in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leakage into your home unnoticed. Indications of this may be frequent headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like symptoms.

Your AC installer will understand what to look for.<p>
<p>If a contractor does not have a strong grasp of local policies or appropriate local, regional, and federal rewards-- like the ones found at the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Effectiveness, they may leave that to you and subsequently lower their charges considering that they have less paperwork to fret about.
