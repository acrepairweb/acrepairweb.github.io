<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally greater than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you buy.
