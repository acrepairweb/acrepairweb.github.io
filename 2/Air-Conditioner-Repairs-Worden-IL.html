<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
