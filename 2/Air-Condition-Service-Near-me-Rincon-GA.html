<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination.
