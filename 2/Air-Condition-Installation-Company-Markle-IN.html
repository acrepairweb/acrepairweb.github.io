<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
