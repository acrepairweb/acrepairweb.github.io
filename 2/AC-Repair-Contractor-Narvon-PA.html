<p>Brian was every bit honest, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, informative and handy - his work was remarkable! All of his assistants were conscientious and polite. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned up. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size.
